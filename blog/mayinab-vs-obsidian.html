          <h2>Obsidian Is Amazing — But Not for Studying</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Obsidian</strong> is one of the best note-taking apps ever made. Its local-first philosophy, Markdown files, bidirectional linking, graph view, and massive plugin ecosystem have made it the go-to tool for <strong>personal knowledge management (PKM)</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's the thing: Obsidian was built for <strong>thinking and connecting ideas</strong>, not for <strong>studying and memorizing</strong>. If you're a student who needs to create flashcards, schedule reviews with spaced repetition, and actually retain information for exams — Obsidian requires a patchwork of community plugins and manual configuration.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab</strong> was designed from day one as a <strong>study app</strong>. Notes and flashcards live together in the same timeline. Spaced repetition (SM-2) works out of the box. No plugins, no YAML frontmatter, no configuration files. Just open and study.
          </p>

          <h2>The Plugin Problem: Flashcards in Obsidian</h2>
          <p>
            Obsidian doesn't ship with flashcards or spaced repetition. To study with Obsidian, you need to:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Browse the community plugin catalog and install a flashcard plugin (like "Spaced Repetition" or "Flashcards")</li>
            <li>Learn the plugin's specific syntax (e.g., <code>#flashcards</code> tags, <code>::</code> separators, or YAML frontmatter)</li>
            <li>Configure review settings, card types, and scheduling parameters</li>
            <li>Hope the plugin doesn't break after an Obsidian update</li>
            <li>Accept limited review modes — most plugins only support basic flip cards</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            In <strong>Mayinab</strong>, you type <code>/flashcard</code> in the chat bar. Done. The card appears inline with your notes, gets scheduled automatically with SM-2, and offers both flip and typing modes. No configuration, no frontmatter, no plugin maintenance.
          </p>

          <h2>Studying vs. Knowledge Management</h2>
          <p>
            This is the core philosophical difference. <strong>Obsidian</strong> is built for <strong>thinking</strong> — connecting ideas across notes, building a personal wiki, creating a "second brain" with bidirectional links and graph views.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab</strong> is built for <strong>learning</strong> — creating study material, testing yourself with active recall, and using spaced repetition to move knowledge from short-term to long-term memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are different goals. Obsidian helps you <em>organize</em> what you know. Mayinab helps you <em>remember</em> what you're learning. For students preparing for exams, certifications, or language learning, the ability to remember is what matters most.
          </p>

          <h2>Both Are Local-First — But Different</h2>
          <p>
            One area where Obsidian and Mayinab share philosophy is <strong>data ownership</strong>. Both apps store your data locally on your device. Both work 100% offline. Both respect your privacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The difference is in <strong>sync</strong>. Obsidian charges <strong>$4/month</strong> for Obsidian Sync (end-to-end encrypted cloud sync). You can also use third-party solutions like iCloud, Dropbox, or Syncthing, but these come with sync conflict risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mayinab offers <strong>free encrypted cloud backup (AES-256)</strong>. Your data is encrypted on your device before upload — even Mayinab's servers can't read it. No subscription required.
          </p>

          <h2>The Learning Curve</h2>
          <p>
            Obsidian is powerful, but that power comes with complexity. A typical new user needs to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understand vaults, files, and folder structures</li>
            <li>Learn Markdown syntax (headers, links, embeds)</li>
            <li>Browse and install core + community plugins</li>
            <li>Configure settings, hotkeys, and CSS snippets</li>
            <li>Set up a workflow (daily notes, templates, Zettelkasten, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For power users, this is part of the appeal. For a student who just wants to <strong>make flashcards and study</strong>, it's an unnecessary barrier. Many students spend more time configuring Obsidian than actually studying with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mayinab has <strong>zero setup</strong>. Download, open, create a subject, start typing notes and flashcards. The chat-style interface is as intuitive as sending a message. You can be productive in under 60 seconds.
          </p>

          <h2>7 Note Types vs. Markdown Everything</h2>
          <p>
            Obsidian's approach is elegant: everything is a Markdown file. This means your notes are future-proof, portable, and readable in any text editor. It's a genuine advantage for long-term knowledge storage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mayinab offers <strong>7 purpose-built note types</strong> optimized for studying:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Text notes</strong> — Markdown + LaTeX with wiki-links and #tags</li>
            <li><strong>Flashcards</strong> — front/back with flip and typing modes, SM-2 scheduling</li>
            <li><strong>Checklists</strong> — track study goals and daily tasks</li>
            <li><strong>Image notes</strong> — with built-in scribble pad for annotations and diagrams</li>
            <li><strong>Audio notes</strong> — record or attach lectures directly</li>
            <li><strong>Video notes</strong> — embed video references inline</li>
            <li><strong>File attachments</strong> — drag & drop PDFs, slides, and documents</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While Obsidian can embed images, audio, and files in Markdown, Mayinab treats each type as a <strong>first-class citizen</strong> with dedicated UIs and controls. The scribble pad for drawing diagrams, for example, has no Obsidian equivalent.
          </p>

          <h2>Desktop Experience</h2>
          <p>
            Both apps offer excellent desktop experiences. Obsidian's interface is inspired by code editors like VS Code — multiple panes, a file explorer sidebar, and a command palette (<code>Ctrl+P</code>). It feels like an IDE for your notes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mayinab's desktop interface is inspired by messaging apps like Discord — a sidebar with subject/topic navigation, a chat-style main area for notes, and a command palette (<code>Ctrl+K</code>). It feels like texting yourself study material.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both support split views, keyboard shortcuts, and custom themes. The choice comes down to which metaphor resonates with you: <strong>IDE for knowledge</strong> (Obsidian) or <strong>chat for studying</strong> (Mayinab).
          </p>

            <h3>🍵 The Verdict</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Obsidian</strong> is a phenomenal tool for personal knowledge management. If you're building a "second brain," connecting research, or writing long-form content, it's hard to beat.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Mayinab</strong> is the better choice for <strong>active studying</strong>. If your goal is to create flashcards quickly, review them with spaced repetition, and actually remember what you learn — Mayinab does this out of the box, without plugins or configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many students use <strong>both</strong>: Obsidian for long-term knowledge organization and Mayinab for daily study sessions and exam preparation. They solve different problems, and that's okay.

          <h2>Obsidian É Incrível — Mas Não para Estudar</h2>
          <p>
            O <strong>Obsidian</strong> é um dos melhores apps de anotação já criados. Sua filosofia local-first, arquivos Markdown, links bidirecionais, visão em grafo e enorme ecossistema de plugins fizeram dele a ferramenta preferida para <strong>gestão de conhecimento pessoal (PKM)</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mas aqui está o ponto: o Obsidian foi feito para <strong>pensar e conectar ideias</strong>, não para <strong>estudar e memorizar</strong>. Se você é um estudante que precisa criar flashcards, agendar revisões com repetição espaçada e realmente reter informação para provas — o Obsidian exige uma colcha de retalhos de plugins e configuração manual.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab</strong> foi projetado desde o primeiro dia como um <strong>app de estudos</strong>. Notas e flashcards vivem juntos na mesma timeline. A repetição espaçada (SM-2) funciona direto da caixa. Sem plugins, sem YAML frontmatter, sem arquivos de configuração. Abra e estude.
          </p>

          <h2>O Problema dos Plugins: Flashcards no Obsidian</h2>
          <p>
            O Obsidian não vem com flashcards ou repetição espaçada. Para estudar com o Obsidian, você precisa:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Navegar pelo catálogo de plugins da comunidade e instalar um plugin de flashcards (como "Spaced Repetition" ou "Flashcards")</li>
            <li>Aprender a sintaxe específica do plugin (ex.: tags <code>#flashcards</code>, separadores <code>::</code> ou YAML frontmatter)</li>
            <li>Configurar parâmetros de revisão, tipos de card e agendamento</li>
            <li>Torcer para o plugin não quebrar após uma atualização do Obsidian</li>
            <li>Aceitar modos de revisão limitados — a maioria dos plugins suporta apenas flip básico</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            No <strong>Mayinab</strong>, você digita <code>/flashcard</code> na barra de chat. Pronto. O card aparece junto com suas notas, é agendado automaticamente com SM-2 e oferece modos flip e digitação. Sem configuração, sem frontmatter, sem manutenção de plugins.
          </p>

          <h2>Estudar vs. Gestão de Conhecimento</h2>
          <p>
            Essa é a diferença filosófica central. O <strong>Obsidian</strong> é feito para <strong>pensar</strong> — conectar ideias entre notas, construir uma wiki pessoal, criar um "segundo cérebro" com links bidirecionais e visão em grafo.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab</strong> é feito para <strong>aprender</strong> — criar material de estudo, se testar com recall ativo e usar repetição espaçada para mover conhecimento da memória de curto prazo para a de longo prazo.
          </p>
          <p>
            São objetivos diferentes. O Obsidian ajuda a <em>organizar</em> o que você sabe. O Mayinab ajuda a <em>lembrar</em> o que está aprendendo. Para estudantes se preparando para provas, certificações ou aprendendo idiomas, a capacidade de lembrar é o que mais importa.
          </p>

          <h2>Ambos São Local-First — Mas Diferentes</h2>
          <p>
            Uma área onde Obsidian e Mayinab compartilham filosofia é a <strong>propriedade dos dados</strong>. Ambos os apps armazenam seus dados localmente no dispositivo. Ambos funcionam 100% offline. Ambos respeitam sua privacidade.
          </p>
          <p>
            A diferença está no <strong>sync</strong>. O Obsidian cobra <strong>$4/mês</strong> pelo Obsidian Sync (sincronização criptografada end-to-end). Você pode usar soluções de terceiros como iCloud, Dropbox ou Syncthing, mas com risco de conflitos de sincronização.
          </p>
          <p>
            O Mayinab oferece <strong>backup cloud criptografado grátis (AES-256)</strong>. Seus dados são criptografados no dispositivo antes do upload — nem os servidores do Mayinab conseguem ler. Sem assinatura necessária.
          </p>

          <h2>A Curva de Aprendizado</h2>
          <p>
            O Obsidian é poderoso, mas esse poder vem com complexidade. Um novo usuário típico precisa:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Entender vaults, arquivos e estruturas de pastas</li>
            <li>Aprender sintaxe Markdown (cabeçalhos, links, embeds)</li>
            <li>Navegar e instalar plugins core + da comunidade</li>
            <li>Configurar opções, atalhos e snippets CSS</li>
            <li>Montar um workflow (daily notes, templates, Zettelkasten, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Para power users, isso faz parte do charme. Para um estudante que só quer <strong>criar flashcards e estudar</strong>, é uma barreira desnecessária. Muitos estudantes gastam mais tempo configurando o Obsidian do que realmente estudando com ele.
          </p>
          <p>
            O Mayinab tem <strong>zero setup</strong>. Baixe, abra, crie uma matéria e comece a digitar notas e flashcards. A interface estilo chat é tão intuitiva quanto mandar uma mensagem. Você pode ser produtivo em menos de 60 segundos.
          </p>

          <h2>7 Tipos de Nota vs. Markdown para Tudo</h2>
          <p>
            A abordagem do Obsidian é elegante: tudo é um arquivo Markdown. Isso significa que suas notas são à prova de futuro, portáveis e legíveis em qualquer editor de texto. É uma vantagem genuína para armazenamento de conhecimento a longo prazo.
          </p>
          <p>
            O Mayinab oferece <strong>7 tipos de nota construídos para estudo</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Notas de texto</strong> — Markdown + LaTeX com wiki-links e #tags</li>
            <li><strong>Flashcards</strong> — frente/verso com modos flip e digitação, agendamento SM-2</li>
            <li><strong>Checklists</strong> — acompanhe metas e tarefas de estudo</li>
            <li><strong>Notas com imagem</strong> — com scribble pad integrado para anotações e diagramas</li>
            <li><strong>Notas de áudio</strong> — grave ou anexe aulas diretamente</li>
            <li><strong>Notas de vídeo</strong> — referências de vídeo inline</li>
            <li><strong>Anexos de arquivo</strong> — arraste e solte PDFs, slides e documentos</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Embora o Obsidian possa incorporar imagens, áudio e arquivos no Markdown, o Mayinab trata cada tipo como um <strong>cidadão de primeira classe</strong> com UIs e controles dedicados. O scribble pad para desenhar diagramas, por exemplo, não tem equivalente no Obsidian.
          </p>

          <h2>Experiência Desktop</h2>
          <p>
            Ambos os apps oferecem excelentes experiências desktop. A interface do Obsidian é inspirada em editores de código como VS Code — múltiplos painéis, explorador de arquivos na sidebar e paleta de comandos (<code>Ctrl+P</code>). Parece uma IDE para suas notas.
          </p>
          <p>
            A interface desktop do Mayinab é inspirada em apps de mensagem como Discord — sidebar com navegação de matérias/tópicos, área principal estilo chat para notas e paleta de comandos (<code>Ctrl+K</code>). Parece que você está enviando material de estudo para si mesmo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ambos suportam visão dividida, atalhos de teclado e temas customizáveis. A escolha se resume a qual metáfora faz mais sentido para você: <strong>IDE para conhecimento</strong> (Obsidian) ou <strong>chat para estudo</strong> (Mayinab).
          </p>

            <h3>🍵 O Veredicto</h3>
            <p>
              O <strong>Obsidian</strong> é uma ferramenta fenomenal para gestão de conhecimento pessoal. Se você está construindo um "segundo cérebro", conectando pesquisas ou escrevendo conteúdo longo, é difícil de superar.
            </p>
            <p>
              O <strong>Mayinab</strong> é a melhor escolha para <strong>estudo ativo</strong>. Se seu objetivo é criar flashcards rapidamente, revisá-los com repetição espaçada e realmente lembrar o que aprendeu — o Mayinab faz isso direto da caixa, sem plugins ou configuração.
            </p>
            <p>
              Muitos estudantes usam <strong>ambos</strong>: Obsidian para organização de conhecimento de longo prazo e Mayinab para sessões de estudo diárias e preparação para provas. Eles resolvem problemas diferentes, e tudo bem.
