          <h2>Quick Overview</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>SuperMemo</strong> is the <em>original</em> spaced repetition software, created by Dr. Piotr Woźniak in the 1980s. It pioneered the SM algorithm family and introduced the concept of <strong>incremental reading</strong>. It's respected by a niche but devoted community of learners.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab</strong> is a modern study app that uses the <strong>SM-2 algorithm</strong> — the very algorithm Dr. Woźniak created in 1987 — wrapped in a chat-style interface with 7 note types, Markdown + LaTeX, and full offline support.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it this way: SuperMemo invented the engine. Mayinab puts that engine in a modern car.
          </p>

          <h2>The Algorithm: SM-2 vs SM-18</h2>
          <p>
            This is the most nuanced comparison point. Both apps are rooted in the same research by Dr. Woźniak.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab</strong> uses <strong>SM-2</strong>, the algorithm published in 1987. It remains the most widely-adopted spaced repetition algorithm in the world (Anki uses it too). SM-2 is simple, well-understood, and effective. Each card tracks an ease factor that adapts based on recall quality. It works excellently for the vast majority of learners.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>SuperMemo</strong> has evolved through 18 iterations to <strong>SM-18</strong>, a significantly more complex algorithm that models memory stability, retrievability, and uses advanced statistical methods. SM-18 is theoretically more optimal than SM-2, particularly for users with very large collections (10,000+ items) or decades of learning history.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, <strong>the difference is marginal for most students</strong>. SM-2 produces excellent retention rates, and its simplicity means fewer edge cases and more predictable behavior. SM-18's advantages become noticeable mainly for power users with massive long-term collections.
          </p>

          <h2>User Interface: Modern vs Legacy</h2>
          <p>
            This is where the comparison becomes most dramatic.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>SuperMemo's desktop app</strong> (Windows only) has an interface from the early 2000s. It uses a complex multi-window layout with toolbars, trees, and menus that require significant time to learn. The web version (supermemo.com) is more modern but still not intuitive. Many potential users abandon SuperMemo because the learning curve is too steep.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab</strong> was designed for <strong>today's students</strong>. The chat-style timeline is as natural as texting. Creating a flashcard takes one command (<code>/flashcard</code>). The split-view on desktop, command palette (Ctrl+K), and sidebar navigation feel inspired by modern tools like Discord and VS Code. You can be productive within seconds of opening the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you've ever tried SuperMemo and felt overwhelmed, Mayinab solves that exact problem.
          </p>

          <h2>Incremental Reading</h2>
          <p>
            SuperMemo's unique killer feature is <strong>incremental reading</strong>: a method for reading articles piece by piece, extracting important fragments, and converting them into flashcards, all scheduled by the SRS algorithm. It's a powerful study technique championed by Dr. Woźniak.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab does not have incremental reading.</strong> Instead, it focuses on a different workflow: you take notes (text, audio, images, video) in a chat timeline and create flashcards alongside them. The notes and flashcards coexist, giving you context when reviewing.
          </p>
          <p>
            If incremental reading is essential to your workflow, SuperMemo is the only app that does it properly. For most students who take traditional notes and make flashcards, Mayinab's approach is more intuitive and equally effective.
          </p>

          <h2>Pricing &amp; Platform Support</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab</strong> is <strong>100% free</strong> on all platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. All features included. The only paid option is Vault (encrypted cloud backup) starting at $1.50/month.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>SuperMemo</strong> has a fragmented pricing model. The desktop app (Windows only) costs a one-time fee of approximately $66. The web version (supermemo.com) costs $5.99/month. The mobile app (Android/iOS) is free but limited and doesn't sync seamlessly with the desktop version. There's no native macOS or Linux support.
          </p>
          <p>
            For students who use Mac, Linux, or need a consistent cross-platform experience, SuperMemo simply doesn't work. Mayinab runs natively everywhere.
          </p>

          <h2>Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Both apps respect privacy in different ways. <strong>SuperMemo desktop</strong> stores data locally, similar to Mayinab. <strong>SuperMemo web</strong> requires an account and stores data on their servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab</strong> stores everything locally on all platforms. No account is ever required. Zero tracking, zero analytics. Optional encrypted backup uses AES-256.
          </p>

          <h2>When SuperMemo Is Better</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Incremental reading</strong>: The only app that implements this technique properly.</li>
            <li><strong>SM-18 algorithm</strong>: If you have 10,000+ cards and decades of learning history, SM-18's advanced modeling may produce measurably better scheduling.</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum SRS optimization</strong>: For learners who want the most algorithmically advanced scheduling available.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term Windows users</strong>: If you're already invested in SuperMemo's ecosystem and comfortable with its UI.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>When Mayinab Is Better</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Modern UI</strong>: Chat-style interface vs. 2000s-era desktop, instant productivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-platform</strong>: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS. SuperMemo desktop is Windows-only.</li>
            <li><strong>Free forever</strong>: No $66 desktop license or $5.99/month subscription.</li>
            <li><strong>Notes + flashcards</strong>: 7 note types in one timeline. SuperMemo focuses on flashcards and incremental reading.</li>
            <li><strong>Zero setup time</strong>: Open, type, study. No hours-long learning curve.</li>
            <li><strong>Markdown + LaTeX</strong>: Native support for formulas and formatted text.</li>
            <li><strong>Media-rich studying</strong>: Audio, video, images, file attachments, drawing pad.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy on all platforms</strong>: Local data everywhere, not just on Windows desktop.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="verdict-box">
            <h3>🍵 Verdict</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>SuperMemo is the pioneer of spaced repetition and still the most algorithmically advanced option.</strong> If you practice incremental reading, have a massive card collection, and are comfortable with a complex Windows-only desktop app, SuperMemo offers unmatched scheduling precision.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Mayinab is the modern way to use SM-2.</strong> The same foundational algorithm that made SuperMemo legendary, in a beautiful cross-platform app with notes + flashcards, Markdown + LaTeX, and full offline support — all for free. For 99% of students, Mayinab delivers the benefits of spaced repetition without the complexity tax.

          <h2>Visão Geral</h2>
          <p>
            O <strong>SuperMemo</strong> é o <em>software original</em> de repetição espaçada, criado pelo Dr. Piotr Woźniak nos anos 1980. Ele pioneirou a família de algoritmos SM e introduziu o conceito de <strong>leitura incremental</strong>. É respeitado por uma comunidade nichada mas dedicada.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab</strong> é um app de estudo moderno que usa o <strong>algoritmo SM-2</strong> — o mesmo algoritmo criado pelo Dr. Woźniak em 1987 — com interface estilo chat, 7 tipos de nota, Markdown + LaTeX e suporte offline completo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pense assim: o SuperMemo inventou o motor. O Mayinab colocou esse motor em um carro moderno.

          <h2>O Algoritmo: SM-2 vs SM-18</h2>
          <p>
            Esse é o ponto mais nuançado da comparação. Ambos são enraizados na mesma pesquisa do Dr. Woźniak.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab</strong> usa <strong>SM-2</strong>, o algoritmo publicado em 1987. É o algoritmo de repetição espaçada mais adotado do mundo (Anki também usa). SM-2 é simples, bem compreendido e eficaz. Cada card rastreia um fator de facilidade que se adapta à qualidade de recordação.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>SuperMemo</strong> evoluiu por 18 iterações até o <strong>SM-18</strong>, um algoritmo significativamente mais complexo que modela estabilidade de memória, recuperabilidade e usa métodos estatísticos avançados. SM-18 é teoricamente mais otimizado que SM-2, especialmente para coleções grandes (10.000+ itens) ou décadas de histórico de aprendizado.
          </p>
          <p>
            Na prática, <strong>a diferença é marginal para a maioria dos estudantes</strong>. SM-2 produz excelentes taxas de retenção. As vantagens do SM-18 se tornam perceptíveis principalmente para power users com coleções massivas de longo prazo.
          </p>

          <h2>Interface: Moderna vs Legada</h2>
          <p>
            Aqui a comparação fica mais dramática.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>app desktop do SuperMemo</strong> (apenas Windows) tem interface dos anos 2000. Usa layout multi-janelas complexo com toolbars, árvores e menus que exigem tempo para aprender. A versão web é mais moderna mas ainda não intuitiva. Muitos desistem do SuperMemo pela curva de aprendizado.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab</strong> foi projetado para <strong>estudantes de hoje</strong>. A timeline chat é natural como mandar mensagem. Criar flashcard leva um comando (<code>/flashcard</code>). Split-view, paleta de comandos e sidebar são inspirados em Discord e VS Code. Você fica produtivo em segundos.
          </p>

          <h2>Leitura Incremental</h2>
          <p>
            O recurso único do SuperMemo é a <strong>leitura incremental</strong>: ler artigos pedaço por pedaço, extrair fragmentos e converter em flashcards, tudo agendado pelo SRS.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab não tem leitura incremental</strong>. Foca em workflow diferente: notas (texto, áudio, imagens, vídeo) em timeline chat com flashcards ao lado. As notas dão contexto durante a revisão.
          </p>
          <p>
            Se leitura incremental é essencial, o SuperMemo é a única opção. Para a maioria que faz notas tradicionais e flashcards, o Mayinab é mais intuitivo e igualmente eficaz.
          </p>

          <h2>Preço &amp; Plataformas</h2>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab</strong> é <strong>100% grátis</strong> em todas as plataformas: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android e iOS. O Vault (backup criptografado) é a única opção paga, a partir de $1.50/mês.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>SuperMemo</strong> tem modelo fragmentado. O desktop (apenas Windows) custa ~$66. A versão web custa $5.99/mês. O app mobile é gratuito mas limitado e não sincroniza bem com o desktop. Sem suporte para macOS ou Linux.
          </p>
          <p>
            Para quem usa Mac, Linux ou precisa de experiência cross-platform consistente, o SuperMemo simplesmente não funciona. O Mayinab roda nativamente em tudo.
          </p>

          <h2>Privacidade</h2>
          <p>
            Ambos respeitam privacidade de formas diferentes. O <strong>SuperMemo desktop</strong> armazena dados localmente, similar ao Mayinab. O <strong>SuperMemo web</strong> requer conta e armazena na cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab</strong> armazena tudo localmente em todas as plataformas. Sem conta necessária. Zero rastreamento, zero analytics. Backup opcional usa AES-256.
          </p>

          <h2>Quando o SuperMemo É Melhor</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Leitura incremental</strong>: Único app que implementa essa técnica corretamente.</li>
            <li><strong>Algoritmo SM-18</strong>: Para 10.000+ cards e décadas de histórico, pode produzir agendamento mais otimizado.</li>
            <li><strong>Otimização máxima de SRS</strong>: Para quem quer o algoritmo mais avançado disponível.</li>
            <li><strong>Usuários Windows veteranos</strong>: Se já está investido no ecossistema e confortável com a UI.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Quando o Mayinab É Melhor</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>UI moderna</strong>: Interface chat vs. desktop anos 2000, produtividade instantânea.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-platform</strong>: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS. SuperMemo desktop é só Windows.</li>
            <li><strong>Grátis para sempre</strong>: Sem licença de $66 nem assinatura de $5.99/mês.</li>
            <li><strong>Notas + flashcards</strong>: 7 tipos de nota em uma timeline.</li>
            <li><strong>Zero setup</strong>: Abrir, digitar, estudar. Sem horas de aprendizado.</li>
            <li><strong>Markdown + LaTeX</strong>: Suporte nativo para fórmulas e texto formatado.</li>
            <li><strong>Estudo multimídia</strong>: Áudio, vídeo, imagens, anexos, bloco de desenho.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacidade em todas as plataformas</strong>: Dados locais em todo lugar.</li>
          </ul>

            <h3>🍵 Veredito</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>O SuperMemo é o pioneiro da repetição espaçada e a opção mais avançada algoritmicamente.</strong> Se você pratica leitura incremental, tem coleção massiva e está confortável com um app desktop complexo só para Windows, o SuperMemo oferece precisão de agendamento incomparável.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>O Mayinab é a forma moderna de usar SM-2.</strong> O mesmo algoritmo fundacional que fez o SuperMemo célebre, em um app bonito e cross-platform com notas + flashcards, Markdown + LaTeX e suporte offline — tudo grátis. Para 99% dos estudantes, o Mayinab entrega os benefícios da repetição espaçada sem a taxa de complexidade.
