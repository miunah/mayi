          <h2>The Vocabulary Problem: Why Most Language Learners Plateau</h2>
          <p>
            Every language learner hits the same wall. You study for weeks, learn hundreds of words, feel like you're making progress... then one day you realize you've <strong>forgotten half of what you learned</strong>. You go back, re-learn it, and the cycle repeats.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn't a motivation problem. It's a <strong>memory problem</strong>. The forgetting curve, discovered by Herman Ebbinghaus in 1885, shows that we forget up to 70% of new information within 24 hours. Without a system to fight this, language study becomes an endless loop of learning and forgetting.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Spaced repetition</strong> is the solution. By reviewing vocabulary at scientifically optimal intervals, you transfer words from short-term to long-term memory efficiently. And the best tool for this is a flashcard app with SM-2 algorithm support.
          </p>

          <h2>How Many Words Do You Need?</h2>
          <p>
            Research in applied linguistics provides clear benchmarks for vocabulary size:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>250 words:</strong> Basic survival (greetings, numbers, common verbs)</li>
            <li><strong>500 words:</strong> Simple conversations about daily life</li>
            <li><strong>2,000 words:</strong> ~80% comprehension of everyday spoken language</li>
            <li><strong>5,000 words:</strong> ~95% comprehension, comfortable conversational fluency</li>
            <li><strong>10,000+ words:</strong> Near-native comprehension, academic and professional fluency</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Memorizing 2,000-5,000 words sounds daunting, but with spaced repetition and 15-20 new cards per day, you can reach 2,000 words in about <strong>4-5 months</strong> and 5,000 in about <strong>10-12 months</strong>. The SM-2 algorithm ensures you don't forget old words while adding new ones.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Flashcards + Spaced Repetition Work for Languages</h2>
          <p>
            Language learning combines two challenges flashcards are perfect for:
          </p>

          <h3>1. Massive Volume of Discrete Facts</h3>
          <p>
            Vocabulary words, verb conjugations, grammar rules, idiomatic expressions: these are <strong>individual facts that need to be memorized</strong>. Flashcards break them into atomic units, one concept per card, which is the most efficient format for memory.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Long-Term Retention Required</h3>
          <p>
            Unlike studying for a test (where you need to remember for one day), language learning requires you to <strong>remember vocabulary for years</strong>. Spaced repetition is the only study technique proven to produce this kind of long-term retention.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Active Recall Over Passive Review</h3>
          <p>
            Reading a vocabulary list and thinking "I know this" doesn't work. Flashcards force you to <strong>actively retrieve</strong> the translation from memory before checking. This retrieval practice is 3x more effective than passive review.
          </p>

          <h2>How to Study Any Language with Mayinab</h2>

          <h3>Step 1: Create Language-Specific Notebooks</h3>
          <p>
            Organize your study material into notebooks by topic or level:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Basics:</strong> Greetings, numbers, colors, days, months</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Life:</strong> Food, family, house, work, hobbies</li>
            <li><strong>Travel:</strong> Directions, transportation, hotel, restaurant</li>
            <li><strong>Grammar:</strong> Verb conjugations, tenses, prepositions, cases</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Idioms, formal language, specialized vocabulary</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 2: Build Effective Vocabulary Flashcards</h3>
          <p>
            The best vocabulary flashcard format:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Front:</strong> Target language word (e.g., "Bibliothek")</li>
            <li><strong>Back:</strong> Translation + gender/article + example sentence (e.g., "Library (die Bibliothek). Ich gehe in die Bibliothek. = I go to the library.")</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Tips for better cards:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>One word per card.</strong> Don't put multiple words on a single card.</li>
            <li><strong>Include context.</strong> An example sentence makes the word 2x easier to remember.</li>
            <li><strong>Add grammatical info.</strong> Gender, article, plural form, verb group.</li>
            <li><strong>Use both directions.</strong> Create cards in both directions (target → native and native → target) for production and recognition.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 3: Add Grammar Cards</h3>
          <p>
            Grammar is more than rules: it's patterns. Create flashcards for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Verb conjugation tables</strong>: "How do you conjugate 'ser' in the present tense?"</li>
            <li><strong>Grammar rules</strong>: "When do you use subjunctive in Spanish?"</li>
            <li><strong>Sentence patterns</strong>: "How do you form a question in German?"</li>
            <li><strong>Exception lists</strong>: "What are the irregular past participles in French?"</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 4: Take Notes Alongside Flashcards</h3>
          <p>
            This is where Mayinab truly shines. Instead of using one app for notes (Notion, Google Docs) and another for flashcards (Anki, Quizlet), you can do both in the same timeline. Write a note explaining a grammar concept, then create flashcards right below it using <code>/flashcard</code>.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 5: Review Daily, No Exceptions</h3>
          <p>
            Spaced repetition only works with <strong>daily consistency</strong>. The SM-2 algorithm schedules cards at optimal intervals, but skipping days causes review pile-up. Aim for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>15-20 minutes daily</strong> for review</li>
            <li><strong>10-20 new cards per day</strong> (don't go higher)</li>
            <li><strong>Morning review</strong> is most effective (fresh brain)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Flashcard Examples for Popular Languages</h2>

          <h3>Spanish</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Front:</strong> madrugada</li>
            <li><strong>Back:</strong> Early morning / dawn (la madrugada, f.). "Me levanto en la madrugada." = I wake up in the early morning.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>French</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Front:</strong> quand meme</li>
            <li><strong>Back:</strong> Nevertheless / still / anyway (adverb). "Il pleut, mais je sors quand meme." = It's raining, but I'm going out anyway.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>German</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Front:</strong> die Sehnsucht</li>
            <li><strong>Back:</strong> Longing / yearning (die Sehnsucht, f., no plural common). "Ich habe Sehnsucht nach meiner Heimat." = I long for my homeland.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Italian</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Front:</strong> comunque</li>
            <li><strong>Back:</strong> However / anyway / in any case (adverb/conjunction). "Comunque, non importa." = Anyway, it doesn't matter.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Korean</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Front:</strong> 감사합니다 (gamsahamnida)</li>
            <li><strong>Back:</strong> Thank you (formal). Formal form of 고맙다. Used in most polite situations.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Russian</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Front:</strong> библиотека (biblioteka)</li>
            <li><strong>Back:</strong> Library (f.). "Я иду в библиотеку." = I'm going to the library. (Note: accusative case after "в" for direction.)</li>
          </ul>

              <tr>
                <td>Year 2+</td>
                <td>8,000-12,000+</td>
                <td>Near-native vocabulary</td>
                <td>15-20 min</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>
            Notice that daily effort <strong>decreases over time</strong> despite vocabulary growing. This is the power of spaced repetition: old cards reach very long intervals (weeks or months between reviews), so your daily review load stabilizes even as total vocabulary grows.
          </p>

          <h2>The Mayinab Advantage for Language Learners</h2>
          <p>
            Most language learners use multiple apps: Duolingo for gamified lessons, Anki for flashcards, Notion or Google Docs for grammar notes. This creates friction, switching between apps, losing context, and duplicating effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mayinab solves this by combining <strong>notes and flashcards in one timeline</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Write grammar explanations</strong> as notes, then create flashcards below them</li>
            <li><strong>Use 7 note types:</strong> text, flashcards, checklists, images, audio, video, files</li>
            <li><strong>SM-2 spaced repetition</strong> handles review scheduling automatically</li>
            <li><strong>Flip mode</strong> for recognition and <strong>typing mode</strong> for production</li>
            <li><strong>100% offline:</strong> study on planes, trains, or anywhere without internet</li>
            <li><strong>All platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS</li>
            <li><strong>Free forever:</strong> no ads, no paywall, no freemium tricks</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>10 Tips for Learning Any Language</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Start with the 500 most frequent words.</strong> They cover ~70% of everyday conversation. Use a frequency list for your target language.</li>
            <li><strong>Learn words in sentences, not isolation.</strong> Context makes vocabulary 2x easier to remember. Always include example sentences in flashcards.</li>
            <li><strong>Create cards in both directions.</strong> Word → Translation (recognition) and Translation → Word (production). You need both skills.</li>
            <li><strong>Study grammar as patterns, not rules.</strong> Instead of memorizing abstract rules, create flashcards with example sentences that demonstrate the pattern.</li>
            <li><strong>Review every single day.</strong> Even 10 minutes counts. Skipping days causes review pile-up and reduces effectiveness.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit new cards to 15-20 per day.</strong> Adding too many causes unsustainable review loads. Slow and steady wins the language race.</li>
            <li><strong>Use your language outside flashcards.</strong> Watch shows, listen to podcasts, read graded readers, speak with native speakers. Flashcards build knowledge; immersion builds fluency.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't chase perfection.</strong> Marking a card "good" when you remembered 80% is fine. Progress matters more than perfection.</li>
            <li><strong>Include pronunciation info.</strong> For languages with different scripts (Korean, Arabic, Russian), include romanization on your cards initially.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust the algorithm.</strong> Don't manually review cards before they're due. The SM-2 algorithm knows when you need to see something again.</li>
          </ol>

            <h3>🍵 Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p>
              Learning a language requires memorizing thousands of words, grammar patterns, and phrases. <strong>Spaced repetition with flashcards is the most efficient way to do this.</strong> Mayinab combines notes and flashcards in one app, with SM-2 scheduling, dual review modes, and full offline support for any language, any script.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you're learning Spanish, French, German, Korean, Japanese, Mandarin, or any other language, Mayinab gives you the tools to build and retain vocabulary efficiently. Free, no ads, available everywhere.

          <h2>O Problema do Vocabulario: Por que a Maioria dos Estudantes de Idiomas Estagna</h2>
          <p>
            Todo estudante de idiomas esbarra no mesmo muro. Voce estuda por semanas, aprende centenas de palavras, sente que esta progredindo... e um dia percebe que <strong>esqueceu metade do que aprendeu</strong>. Volta, re-aprende, e o ciclo repete.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nao e um problema de motivacao. E um <strong>problema de memoria</strong>. A curva do esquecimento, descoberta por Hermann Ebbinghaus em 1885, mostra que esquecemos ate 70% de informacoes novas em 24 horas. Sem um sistema para combater isso, o estudo de idiomas vira um loop infinito de aprender e esquecer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Repeticao espacada</strong> e a solucao. Ao revisar vocabulario em intervalos cientificamente otimizados, voce transfere palavras da memoria de curto prazo para a de longo prazo de forma eficiente. E a melhor ferramenta para isso e um app de flashcards com suporte ao algoritmo SM-2.
          </p>

          <h2>Quantas Palavras Voce Precisa?</h2>
          <p>
            Pesquisas em linguistica aplicada fornecem marcos claros para tamanho de vocabulario:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>250 palavras:</strong> Sobrevivencia basica (cumprimentos, numeros, verbos comuns)</li>
            <li><strong>500 palavras:</strong> Conversas simples sobre vida cotidiana</li>
            <li><strong>2.000 palavras:</strong> ~80% de compreensao da lingua falada no dia a dia</li>
            <li><strong>5.000 palavras:</strong> ~95% de compreensao, fluencia conversacional confortavel</li>
            <li><strong>10.000+ palavras:</strong> Compreensao quase nativa, fluencia academica e profissional</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Memorizar 2.000-5.000 palavras parece assustador, mas com repeticao espacada e 15-20 novos cards por dia, voce pode atingir 2.000 palavras em cerca de <strong>4-5 meses</strong> e 5.000 em cerca de <strong>10-12 meses</strong>. O algoritmo SM-2 garante que voce nao esqueca palavras antigas enquanto adiciona novas.
          </p>

          <h2>Por que Flashcards + Repeticao Espacada Funcionam para Idiomas</h2>
          <p>
            O aprendizado de idiomas combina dois desafios para os quais flashcards sao perfeitos:
          </p>

          <h3>1. Volume Massivo de Fatos Discretos</h3>
          <p>
            Palavras de vocabulario, conjugacoes verbais, regras gramaticais, expressoes idiomaticas: sao <strong>fatos individuais que precisam ser memorizados</strong>. Flashcards os dividem em unidades atomicas, um conceito por card, que e o formato mais eficiente para memoria.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Retencao de Longo Prazo Necessaria</h3>
          <p>
            Diferente de estudar para uma prova (onde voce precisa lembrar por um dia), aprender idiomas exige que voce <strong>lembre vocabulario por anos</strong>. Repeticao espacada e a unica tecnica de estudo comprovada para produzir esse tipo de retencao de longo prazo.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Recall Ativo Sobre Revisao Passiva</h3>
          <p>
            Ler uma lista de vocabulario e pensar "eu sei isso" nao funciona. Flashcards forcam voce a <strong>recuperar ativamente</strong> a traducao da memoria antes de conferir. Essa pratica de recuperacao e 3x mais eficaz que revisao passiva.
          </p>

          <h2>Como Estudar Qualquer Idioma com o Mayinab</h2>

          <h3>Passo 1: Crie Cadernos Especificos por Idioma</h3>
          <p>
            Organize seu material de estudo em cadernos por topico ou nivel:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Basico:</strong> Cumprimentos, numeros, cores, dias, meses</li>
            <li><strong>Vida Cotidiana:</strong> Comida, familia, casa, trabalho, hobbies</li>
            <li><strong>Viagem:</strong> Direcoes, transporte, hotel, restaurante</li>
            <li><strong>Gramatica:</strong> Conjugacoes verbais, tempos, preposicoes, casos</li>
            <li><strong>Avancado:</strong> Expressoes idiomaticas, linguagem formal, vocabulario especializado</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Passo 2: Crie Flashcards de Vocabulario Eficazes</h3>
          <p>
            O melhor formato de flashcard de vocabulario:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Frente:</strong> Palavra no idioma-alvo (ex: "Bibliothek")</li>
            <li><strong>Verso:</strong> Traducao + genero/artigo + frase de exemplo (ex: "Biblioteca (die Bibliothek, f.). Ich gehe in die Bibliothek. = Eu vou a biblioteca.")</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Dicas para cards melhores:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Uma palavra por card.</strong> Nao coloque multiplas palavras em um unico card.</li>
            <li><strong>Inclua contexto.</strong> Uma frase de exemplo torna a palavra 2x mais facil de lembrar.</li>
            <li><strong>Adicione info gramatical.</strong> Genero, artigo, forma plural, grupo verbal.</li>
            <li><strong>Use ambas as direcoes.</strong> Crie cards nos dois sentidos (idioma-alvo → nativo e nativo → idioma-alvo) para producao e reconhecimento.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Passo 3: Adicione Cards de Gramatica</h3>
          <p>
            Gramatica e mais que regras: sao padroes. Crie flashcards para:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tabelas de conjugacao:</strong> "Como conjugar 'etre' no presente?"</li>
            <li><strong>Regras gramaticais:</strong> "Quando usar o subjuntivo em espanhol?"</li>
            <li><strong>Padroes de frase:</strong> "Como formar uma pergunta em alemao?"</li>
            <li><strong>Listas de excecoes:</strong> "Quais sao os participios passados irregulares em frances?"</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Passo 4: Faca Notas Junto com Flashcards</h3>
          <p>
            E aqui que o Mayinab realmente brilha. Em vez de usar um app para notas (Notion, Google Docs) e outro para flashcards (Anki, Quizlet), voce pode fazer ambos na mesma timeline. Escreva uma nota explicando um conceito gramatical, depois crie flashcards logo abaixo usando <code>/flashcard</code>.
          </p>

          <h3>Passo 5: Revise Diariamente, Sem Excecoes</h3>
          <p>
            Repeticao espacada so funciona com <strong>consistencia diaria</strong>. O algoritmo SM-2 agenda cards em intervalos ideais, mas pular dias causa acumulo de revisoes. Mire em:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>15-20 minutos diarios</strong> para revisao</li>
            <li><strong>10-20 novos cards por dia</strong> (nao ultrapasse)</li>
            <li><strong>Revisao matinal</strong> e mais eficaz (cerebro descansado)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Exemplos de Flashcard para Idiomas Populares</h2>

          <h3>Espanhol</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Frente:</strong> madrugada</li>
            <li><strong>Verso:</strong> Madrugada (la madrugada, f.). "Me levanto en la madrugada." = Eu acordo de madrugada.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Frances</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Frente:</strong> quand meme</li>
            <li><strong>Verso:</strong> Mesmo assim / ainda assim (adverbio). "Il pleut, mais je sors quand meme." = Esta chovendo, mas saio mesmo assim.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Alemao</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Frente:</strong> die Sehnsucht</li>
            <li><strong>Verso:</strong> Saudade / anseio (die Sehnsucht, f.). "Ich habe Sehnsucht nach meiner Heimat." = Tenho saudade da minha terra natal.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Italiano</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Frente:</strong> comunque</li>
            <li><strong>Verso:</strong> Porem / de qualquer forma (adverbio/conjuncao). "Comunque, non importa." = De qualquer forma, nao importa.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Coreano</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Frente:</strong> 감사합니다 (gamsahamnida)</li>
            <li><strong>Verso:</strong> Obrigado (formal). Forma formal de 고맙다. Usado nas situacoes mais educadas.</li>
          </ul>

            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>
            Note que o esforco diario <strong>diminui com o tempo</strong> apesar do vocabulario crescer. Esse e o poder da repeticao espacada: cards antigos atingem intervalos muito longos (semanas ou meses entre revisoes), entao sua carga diaria estabiliza mesmo com o vocabulario total crescendo.

          <h2>A Vantagem do Mayinab para Estudantes de Idiomas</h2>
          <p>
            A maioria dos estudantes de idiomas usa multiplos apps: Duolingo para licoes gamificadas, Anki para flashcards, Notion ou Google Docs para notas de gramatica. Isso cria friccao: alternar entre apps, perder contexto e duplicar esforco.
          </p>
          <p>
            O Mayinab resolve isso combinando <strong>notas e flashcards em uma timeline</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Escreva explicacoes gramaticais</strong> como notas, depois crie flashcards abaixo delas</li>
            <li><strong>Use 7 tipos de nota:</strong> texto, flashcards, checklists, imagens, audio, video, arquivos</li>
            <li><strong>Repeticao espacada SM-2</strong> cuida do agendamento automaticamente</li>
            <li><strong>Modo flip</strong> para reconhecimento e <strong>modo digitacao</strong> para producao</li>
            <li><strong>100% offline:</strong> estude em avioes, trens ou em qualquer lugar sem internet</li>
            <li><strong>Todas as plataformas:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS</li>
            <li><strong>Gratis para sempre:</strong> sem anuncios, sem paywall, sem truques freemium</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>10 Dicas para Aprender Qualquer Idioma</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Comece pelas 500 palavras mais frequentes.</strong> Elas cobrem ~70% da conversacao cotidiana. Use uma lista de frequencia do seu idioma-alvo.</li>
            <li><strong>Aprenda palavras em frases, nao isoladas.</strong> Contexto torna vocabulario 2x mais facil de lembrar. Sempre inclua frases de exemplo nos flashcards.</li>
            <li><strong>Crie cards em ambas as direcoes.</strong> Palavra → Traducao (reconhecimento) e Traducao → Palavra (producao). Voce precisa de ambas as habilidades.</li>
            <li><strong>Estude gramatica como padroes, nao regras.</strong> Em vez de memorizar regras abstratas, crie flashcards com frases de exemplo que demonstrem o padrao.</li>
            <li><strong>Revise todos os dias.</strong> Mesmo 10 minutos contam. Pular dias causa acumulo de revisoes e reduz a eficacia.</li>
            <li><strong>Limite novos cards a 15-20 por dia.</strong> Adicionar demais causa cargas de revisao insustentaveis. Devagar e sempre vence a corrida dos idiomas.</li>
            <li><strong>Use o idioma fora dos flashcards.</strong> Assista series, ouca podcasts, leia textos graduados, converse com nativos. Flashcards constroem conhecimento; imersao constroi fluencia.</li>
            <li><strong>Nao busque perfeicao.</strong> Marcar um card como "bom" quando lembrou 80% esta otimo. Progresso importa mais que perfeicao.</li>
            <li><strong>Inclua info de pronuncia.</strong> Para idiomas com escritas diferentes (coreano, arabe, russo), inclua romanizacao nos cards inicialmente.</li>
            <li><strong>Confie no algoritmo.</strong> Nao revise cards manualmente antes da hora. O algoritmo SM-2 sabe quando voce precisa ver algo de novo.</li>
          </ol>
