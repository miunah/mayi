          <h2>Quick Overview</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Brainscape</strong> is a popular paid flashcard app that uses Confidence-Based Repetition (CBR) to optimize review scheduling. It's known for its polished UI and curated content library. <strong>Mayinab</strong> is a modern study app that combines notes and flashcards with SM-2 spaced repetition, a chat-style interface, and a commitment to being <strong>free, offline, and private</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both focus on science-backed studying, but they differ in approach, pricing, and philosophy. Let's compare them.

          <h2>Spaced Repetition: SM-2 vs Confidence-Based Repetition</h2>
          <p>
            The core difference is in the algorithm. Both use spaced repetition, but the underlying systems are distinct.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab</strong> uses the <strong>SM-2 algorithm</strong>, the same proven system behind Anki. Each card has an individual ease factor that adjusts based on your recall quality. Intervals grow exponentially for cards you know and shrink for difficult ones. SM-2 has decades of research backing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Brainscape</strong> uses <strong>Confidence-Based Repetition (CBR)</strong>. After seeing a card, you rate your confidence on a 1–5 scale. Cards you're less confident about appear more frequently. It's intuitive and works well, but it's a proprietary system with less independent research than SM-2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both are effective for learning. SM-2 is more precise with its interval calculations, while CBR is simpler to understand. For long-term retention in high-stakes studying (medical school, bar exam, languages), SM-2's mathematical precision has a proven track record.
          </p>

          <h2>Pricing: Free vs Premium</h2>
          <p>
            This is the biggest differentiator.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab</strong> is <strong>100% free</strong>. Every feature is included: spaced repetition, 7 note types, Markdown, LaTeX, offline mode, themes, unlimited subjects and topics. The only paid option is Vault (encrypted cloud backup) starting at $1.50/month, entirely optional.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Brainscape</strong> is one of the more expensive flashcard apps. The free tier limits you to basic features and a handful of decks. <strong>Brainscape Pro costs $9.99/month</strong> ($59.99/year) and unlocks unlimited decks, offline access, advanced analytics, and the full content library. That's <strong>$120/year</strong> on a monthly plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            For students already paying for textbooks, courses, and living expenses, Brainscape's price tag is hard to justify when Mayinab offers comparable study tools for free.
          </p>

          <h2>Offline Support</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab</strong> works <strong>100% offline by default</strong>. Your data is stored locally on your device. No internet connection needed, ever.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Brainscape</strong> requires internet for the free tier. Offline access is a <strong>Pro-only feature</strong>. If you study on the go, in libraries with spotty Wi-Fi, or during commutes without signal, you'll need to pay for the privilege of offline studying.
          </p>

          <h2>Privacy &amp; Data</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab</strong> stores all data locally. No account required. Zero tracking, zero analytics, zero data collection. Your study data stays on your device.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Brainscape</strong> requires an account and stores everything on their cloud. Your study habits, progress data, and card content are on Brainscape's servers. They use this data to improve their product, but it means your study data isn't truly yours.
          </p>

          <h2>Beyond Flashcards: Notes + Flashcards</h2>
          <p>
            This is where Mayinab pulls far ahead. <strong>Brainscape is a flashcard-only app</strong>. There's no note-taking, no checklists, no audio/video notes, no file attachments. You create flashcards and review them, that's it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab</strong> was built as a <strong>notes + flashcards app</strong>. You have 7 note types in a chat-style timeline: text, flashcards, checklists, images, audio, video, and files. Your lecture notes and flashcards live together. No need for a separate note-taking app.
          </p>
          <p>
            For STEM students, Mayinab also supports <strong>Markdown and LaTeX</strong>, making it easy to write formulas, code snippets, and structured content natively. Brainscape doesn't support either.
          </p>

          <h2>When Brainscape Is Better</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Curated content library</strong>: Brainscape offers professionally-made flashcard decks for subjects like medical boards, bar exam, and languages.</li>
            <li><strong>Team/classroom features</strong>: Teachers and organizations can create and distribute content to students.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplicity of CBR</strong>: The 1–5 confidence rating is extremely easy to understand for casual users.</li>
            <li><strong>Polished mobile experience</strong>: Brainscape's mobile app is clean and focused.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>When Mayinab Is Better</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>You need notes + flashcards</strong>: 7 note types in one timeline vs. cards only.</li>
            <li><strong>Budget-conscious</strong>: Free forever vs. $9.99/month. No contest.</li>
            <li><strong>Offline studying</strong>: Works without internet, always, at no extra cost.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy matters</strong>: Local data, no tracking, no account required.</li>
            <li><strong>STEM students</strong>: Markdown + LaTeX support built-in.</li>
            <li><strong>Proven SRS</strong>: SM-2 algorithm with decades of research backing it.</li>
            <li><strong>Desktop power users</strong>: Split-view, command palette, keyboard shortcuts.</li>
            <li><strong>Linux users</strong>: Mayinab supports Linux; Brainscape doesn't have a desktop app.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="verdict-box">
            <h3>🍵 Verdict</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Brainscape is a polished flashcard app with great curated content.</strong> If you want pre-made, professional flashcard decks for specific certifications or exams and don't mind paying $9.99/month, Brainscape delivers a clean experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Mayinab is better for students who create their own study material.</strong> SM-2 spaced repetition, notes + flashcards in one app, Markdown + LaTeX, full offline support, and complete privacy — all for free. If you're serious about studying and don't want to pay $120/year for flashcards, Mayinab is the clear winner.

          <h2>Repetição Espaçada: SM-2 vs Repetição Baseada em Confiança</h2>
          <p>
            A diferença central está no algoritmo. Ambos usam repetição espaçada, mas os sistemas são distintos.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab</strong> usa o <strong>algoritmo SM-2</strong>, o mesmo sistema por trás do Anki. Cada card tem fator de facilidade individual que se ajusta com base na qualidade de recordação. Intervalos crescem exponencialmente para cards conhecidos e diminuem para os difíceis. SM-2 tem décadas de pesquisa respaldando.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Brainscape</strong> usa <strong>Repetição Baseada em Confiança (CBR)</strong>. Após ver um card, você avalia sua confiança de 1 a 5. Cards com menor confiança aparecem mais frequentemente. É intuitivo, mas proprietário e com menos pesquisa independente que o SM-2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ambos são eficazes para aprender. O SM-2 é mais preciso nos cálculos de intervalo, enquanto o CBR é mais simples de entender. Para retenção de longo prazo em estudos sérios (medicina, direito, idiomas), a precisão matemática do SM-2 tem histórico comprovado.
          </p>

          <h2>Preço: Grátis vs Premium</h2>
          <p>
            Esse é o maior diferenciador.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab</strong> é <strong>100% grátis</strong>. Todos os recursos incluídos: repetição espaçada, 7 tipos de nota, Markdown, LaTeX, modo offline, temas, matérias e tópicos ilimitados. A única opção paga é o Vault (backup cloud criptografado) a partir de $1.50/mês, totalmente opcional.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Brainscape</strong> é um dos apps de flashcards mais caros. O plano grátis limita recursos e decks. O <strong>Brainscape Pro custa $9.99/mês</strong> ($59.99/ano) e libera decks ilimitados, acesso offline, analytics avançados e a biblioteca completa. São <strong>$120/ano</strong> no plano mensal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Para estudantes que já pagam livros, cursos e despesas, o preço do Brainscape é difícil de justificar quando o Mayinab oferece ferramentas comparáveis de graça.
          </p>

          <h2>Suporte Offline</h2>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab</strong> funciona <strong>100% offline por padrão</strong>. Dados armazenados localmente. Sem necessidade de internet, nunca.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Brainscape</strong> requer internet no plano grátis. Acesso offline é <strong>recurso exclusivo do Pro</strong>. Se você estuda em movimento, em bibliotecas com Wi-Fi instável ou no transporte, precisa pagar para estudar offline.
          </p>

          <h2>Privacidade &amp; Dados</h2>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab</strong> armazena tudo localmente. Sem conta obrigatória, zero rastreamento, zero analytics, zero coleta de dados. Seus dados ficam no seu dispositivo.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Brainscape</strong> requer conta e armazena tudo na cloud. Hábitos de estudo, progresso e conteúdo ficam nos servidores do Brainscape.
          </p>

          <h2>Além dos Flashcards: Notas + Flashcards</h2>
          <p>
            Aqui o Mayinab sai muito à frente. O <strong>Brainscape é um app apenas de flashcards</strong>. Sem anotações, sem checklists, sem áudio/vídeo, sem anexos. Você cria flashcards e revisa, só isso.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab</strong> foi construído como <strong>app de notas + flashcards</strong>. São 7 tipos de nota em timeline chat: texto, flashcards, checklists, imagens, áudio, vídeo e arquivos. Notas de aula e flashcards juntos. Sem precisar de app separado.
          </p>
          <p>
            Para estudantes de exatas, o Mayinab suporta <strong>Markdown e LaTeX</strong>, facilitando fórmulas, trechos de código e conteúdo estruturado. O Brainscape não suporta nenhum dos dois.
          </p>

          <h2>Quando o Brainscape É Melhor</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Biblioteca de conteúdo curado</strong>: Decks profissionais para medicina, direito e idiomas.</li>
            <li><strong>Recursos para times</strong>: Professores e organizações podem criar e distribuir conteúdo.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplicidade do CBR</strong>: A avaliação de confiança 1-5 é extremamente fácil de entender.</li>
            <li><strong>Experiência mobile polida</strong>: O app mobile do Brainscape é limpo e focado.</li>
          </ul>
