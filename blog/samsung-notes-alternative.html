          <h2>Samsung Notes Is Good, but Not for Studying</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Samsung Notes</strong> comes pre-installed on every Galaxy phone and tablet. It's great for quick handwriting, drawing, and typing notes. The S Pen integration on Galaxy Tab is excellent, and it syncs with Samsung Cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if you're a student who needs to <strong>actually memorize</strong> what you write, Samsung Notes falls short. There are no flashcards, no spaced repetition, no review scheduling, no Markdown, and no LaTeX. You take notes, and then... they just sit there.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab</strong> is a note-taking app built specifically for studying. It has everything Samsung Notes offers for text notes, plus <strong>built-in flashcards</strong>, <strong>SM-2 spaced repetition</strong>, and a <strong>review system</strong> that ensures you actually retain what you learn.

          <h2>Why Students Need More Than Samsung Notes</h2>
          <p>
            Samsung Notes is designed for <strong>capturing information</strong>: handwritten notes in class, quick text memos, voice recordings. It does this well, especially with the S Pen on Galaxy Tab.
          </p>
          <p>
            But capturing information is only <strong>half the learning process</strong>. The other half is <em>retrieval practice</em> and <em>spaced repetition</em>, the two most effective study techniques according to cognitive science. You need to actively test yourself on what you've written, at scientifically optimal intervals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Samsung Notes has no way to do this. You can't create flashcards from your notes. You can't schedule reviews. You can't track what you've mastered and what you still need to study. Students end up re-reading their notes passively, one of the <strong>least effective study methods</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2>Mayinab: Notes That Actually Help You Remember</h2>
          <p>
            In Mayinab, your study flow is continuous. Take a text note about a topic, then type <code>/flashcard</code> right below it to create a card. The flashcard lives <strong>alongside your notes</strong> in a chat-style timeline. No switching apps, no copy-pasting.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it's time to review, Mayinab's built-in <strong>SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm</strong> schedules your cards automatically. You get flip mode or typing mode, streak tracking, and daily reminders. Your learning is science-based, not just note storage.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the fundamental difference: Samsung Notes stores information. <strong>Mayinab helps you learn it.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2>Works on Your Samsung Galaxy (and Everything Else)</h2>
          <p>
            One major limitation of Samsung Notes is <strong>platform lock-in</strong>. It only works on Samsung Galaxy devices and has a limited Windows app. If you switch to an iPhone, a Pixel, or a non-Samsung laptop, your notes don't follow you easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mayinab runs on <strong>Android, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Linux</strong>. Install it on your Galaxy phone, your Windows laptop, your iPad, and your Linux desktop. Your study workflow is the same everywhere, and optional encrypted cloud backup (AES-256) keeps everything in sync.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you study on a <strong>Galaxy Tab</strong>, Mayinab takes advantage of the large screen with split-view panels, resizable sidebars, and a comfortable reading/reviewing experience. More on tablet support in our <a href="study-app-tablet.html">tablet study app guide</a>.
          </p>

          <h2>7 Note Types vs. Basic Text & Handwriting</h2>
          <p>
            Samsung Notes focuses on three note modes: typing, handwriting, and drawing. These are great for capturing content in class, but limited for building a comprehensive study system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mayinab offers <strong>7 note types designed for studying</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Text notes</strong>: Full Markdown + LaTeX, wiki-links, #tags</li>
            <li><strong>Flashcards</strong>: Flip and typing modes, SM-2 scheduling</li>
            <li><strong>Checklists</strong>: Track study goals and tasks</li>
            <li><strong>Image notes</strong>: With scribble pad for annotations</li>
            <li><strong>Audio notes</strong>: Record or attach lectures</li>
            <li><strong>Video notes</strong>: Video references inline</li>
            <li><strong>File attachments</strong>: Drag and drop PDFs, slides, documents</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Everything is organized in a <strong>Subject → Topic</strong> hierarchy with unlimited nesting. Much more structured than Samsung Notes' flat folder system.
          </p>

          <h2>Markdown & LaTeX: Essential for STEM Students</h2>
          <p>
            Samsung Notes has no Markdown or LaTeX support. If you're studying math, physics, chemistry, or engineering, you can't type formulas like <code>$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$</code> and see them rendered beautifully.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mayinab renders <strong>LaTeX math natively</strong>, both inline and in display blocks. Write formulas in your notes, embed them in flashcards, and review them with spaced repetition. Perfect for STEM subjects where notation matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Full <strong>Markdown support</strong> means headings, bold, italic, code blocks, lists, and links all work out of the box. Format your notes like a wiki without learning a complex editor.
          </p>

          <h2>Privacy & Data Ownership</h2>
          <p>
            Samsung Notes syncs to <strong>Samsung Cloud</strong>, which means your notes are stored on Samsung's servers. If you disable sync, your notes are local but not backed up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mayinab is <strong>local-first by design</strong>. Your data stays on your device. No account required, no tracking, no analytics. If you choose to enable cloud backup, it's encrypted with <strong>AES-256</strong> before leaving your device. Not even Mayinab can read your notes.
          </p>

          <h2>When to Use Samsung Notes vs. Mayinab</h2>

          <div class="verdict-box">
            <h3>📝 Keep Samsung Notes if you need:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Full S Pen handwriting with OCR and shape recognition</li>
              <li>Quick drawings and sketches in class</li>
              <li>Voice recording with handwriting sync</li>
              <li>PDF annotation with S Pen</li>
              <li>A simple memo app for non-study notes</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="verdict-box">
            <h3>🍵 Switch to Mayinab if you need:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Flashcards with SM-2 spaced repetition</li>
              <li>Notes and flashcards in one app, not separate</li>
              <li>Markdown + LaTeX for formatted notes and formulas</li>
              <li>Cross-platform: study on Galaxy, Windows, Mac, iPad, Linux</li>
              <li>Structured organization with Subject → Topic hierarchy</li>
              <li>Privacy-first: no cloud required, AES-256 encrypted backup</li>
              <li>Free with all features, no account required</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="verdict-box">
            <h3>🍵 The Verdict</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Samsung Notes</strong> is an excellent handwriting and quick-note app for Galaxy devices. But for studying, where active recall, spaced repetition, and structured review sessions matter, it is not the right tool.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Mayinab</strong> does one thing exceptionally well: <strong>helping you study and actually remember what you learned</strong>. If you want to go beyond note-taking and build a real study system on your Galaxy device (or any device), Mayinab is the better choice.

          <h2>Samsung Notes É Bom, Mas Não para Estudar</h2>
          <p>
            O <strong>Samsung Notes</strong> vem pré-instalado em todo Galaxy. É ótimo para anotações rápidas à mão, desenhos e digitação. A integração com a S Pen no Galaxy Tab é excelente, e ele sincroniza com o Samsung Cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mas se você é estudante e precisa <strong>realmente memorizar</strong> o que escreve, o Samsung Notes fica devendo. Não tem flashcards, não tem repetição espaçada, não tem agendamento de revisão, não tem Markdown, e não tem LaTeX. Você faz anotações e... elas ficam lá, paradas.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab</strong> é um app de anotações feito especificamente para estudar. Tem tudo que o Samsung Notes oferece para notas de texto, mais <strong>flashcards integrados</strong>, <strong>repetição espaçada SM-2</strong> e um <strong>sistema de revisão</strong> que garante que você realmente retenha o que aprende.
          </p>

          <h2>Por Que Estudantes Precisam de Mais do Que o Samsung Notes</h2>
          <p>
            O Samsung Notes foi feito para <strong>capturar informação</strong>: notas manuscritas em aula, memorandos rápidos, gravações de voz. Faz isso bem, especialmente com a S Pen no Galaxy Tab.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mas capturar informação é apenas <strong>metade do processo de aprendizado</strong>. A outra metade é a <em>prática de recuperação</em> e a <em>repetição espaçada</em>, as duas técnicas de estudo mais eficazes segundo a ciência cognitiva. Você precisa se testar ativamente sobre o que escreveu, em intervalos cientificamente otimizados.
          </p>
          <p>
            O Samsung Notes não tem como fazer isso. Você não consegue criar flashcards a partir das suas notas. Não pode agendar revisões. Não pode rastrear o que já dominou e o que ainda precisa estudar. Estudantes acabam relendo suas notas passivamente, um dos <strong>métodos de estudo menos eficazes</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2>Mayinab: Notas Que Realmente Ajudam a Memorizar</h2>
          <p>
            No Mayinab, seu fluxo de estudo é contínuo. Faça uma anotação sobre um tema, depois digite <code>/flashcard</code> logo abaixo para criar um card. O flashcard fica <strong>junto com suas notas</strong> em uma timeline estilo chat. Sem trocar de app, sem copiar e colar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Na hora de revisar, o algoritmo <strong>SM-2 de repetição espaçada</strong> do Mayinab agenda seus cards automaticamente. Você tem modo flip ou digitação, rastreamento de streak e lembretes diários. Seu aprendizado é baseado em ciência, não apenas armazenamento de notas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Essa é a diferença fundamental: o Samsung Notes armazena informação. <strong>O Mayinab ajuda você a aprender.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2>Funciona no Seu Galaxy (e em Tudo Mais)</h2>
          <p>
            Uma grande limitação do Samsung Notes é o <strong>aprisionamento de plataforma</strong>. Ele só funciona em dispositivos Galaxy e tem um app Windows limitado. Se você trocar para iPhone, Pixel ou notebook não-Samsung, suas notas não migram facilmente.
          </p>
          <p>
            O Mayinab roda em <strong>Android, Windows, macOS, iOS e Linux</strong>. Instale no seu Galaxy, no seu notebook Windows, no seu iPad e no seu desktop Linux. Seu fluxo de estudo é o mesmo em todo lugar, e o backup cloud criptografado opcional (AES-256) mantém tudo sincronizado.
          </p>
          <p>
            Se você estuda em um <strong>Galaxy Tab</strong>, o Mayinab aproveita a tela grande com painéis split-view, sidebars redimensionáveis e uma experiência de leitura/revisão confortável.

          </p>

          <h2>7 Tipos de Nota vs. Texto Básico e Escrita à Mão</h2>
          <p>
            O Samsung Notes foca em três modos: digitação, escrita à mão e desenho. São ótimos para capturar conteúdo em aula, mas limitados para construir um sistema de estudo completo.
          </p>
          <p>
            O Mayinab oferece <strong>7 tipos de nota feitos para estudar</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Notas de texto</strong>: Markdown completo + LaTeX, wiki-links, #tags</li>
            <li><strong>Flashcards</strong>: Modos flip e digitação, agendamento SM-2</li>
            <li><strong>Checklists</strong>: Acompanhe metas e tarefas de estudo</li>
            <li><strong>Notas com imagem</strong>: Com scribble pad integrado para anotações</li>
            <li><strong>Notas de áudio</strong>: Grave ou anexe aulas</li>
            <li><strong>Notas de vídeo</strong>: Referências em vídeo</li>
            <li><strong>Anexos de arquivo</strong>: Arraste e solte PDFs, slides, documentos</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Tudo organizado em hierarquia <strong>Matéria → Tópico</strong> com aninhamento ilimitado. Muito mais estruturado que o sistema de pastas simples do Samsung Notes.
          </p>

          <h2>Markdown e LaTeX: Essenciais para Exatas</h2>
          <p>
            O Samsung Notes não tem suporte a Markdown nem LaTeX. Se você estuda matemática, física, química ou engenharia, não tem como digitar fórmulas como <code>$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$</code> e vê-las renderizadas.
          </p>
          <p>
            O Mayinab renderiza <strong>LaTeX nativamente</strong>, tanto inline quanto em blocos. Escreva fórmulas nas suas notas, coloque em flashcards e revise com repetição espaçada. Perfeito para matérias de exatas onde a notação importa.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Markdown completo</strong> significa headings, negrito, itálico, blocos de código, listas e links funcionando nativamente. Formate suas notas como uma wiki sem aprender um editor complexo.
          </p>

          <h2>Privacidade e Propriedade dos Dados</h2>
          <p>
            O Samsung Notes sincroniza com o <strong>Samsung Cloud</strong>, o que significa que suas notas ficam armazenadas nos servidores da Samsung. Se você desativar a sincronização, suas notas ficam locais mas sem backup.
          </p>
          <p>
            O Mayinab é <strong>local-first por design</strong>. Seus dados ficam no seu dispositivo. Sem conta obrigatória, sem rastreamento, sem analytics. Se você optar pelo backup cloud, ele é criptografado com <strong>AES-256</strong> antes de sair do dispositivo. Nem o Mayinab consegue ler suas notas.
          </p>

            <h3>🍵 O Veredicto</h3>
            <p>
              O <strong>Samsung Notes</strong> é um excelente app de escrita à mão e notas rápidas para dispositivos Galaxy. Mas para estudar, onde recall ativo, repetição espaçada e sessões de revisão estruturadas importam, não é a ferramenta certa.
            </p>
            <p>
              O <strong>Mayinab</strong> faz uma coisa excepcionalmente bem: <strong>ajudar você a estudar e realmente lembrar o que aprendeu</strong>. Se quer ir além de anotar e construir um sistema de estudo real no seu Galaxy (ou qualquer dispositivo), o Mayinab é a melhor escolha.
