          <h2>The Problem: Notes in One App, Flashcards in Another</h2>
          <p>
            If you're a student, you probably know this workflow: take notes in <strong>Notion</strong>, then copy your key points into <strong>Anki</strong> or <strong>Quizlet</strong> to create flashcards. Two apps, double the work, and the constant friction of switching between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Notion</strong> is a fantastic productivity tool: wikis, databases, project boards, shared workspaces. But it was never built for studying. It has no flashcards, no spaced repetition, no review scheduling, and its offline support is limited.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab</strong> was designed from the ground up as a <strong>study-first app</strong>. Notes and flashcards live together in the same timeline. Built-in spaced repetition (SM-2) schedules your reviews automatically. No copy-pasting, no third-party integrations, no internet required.
          </p>

          <h2>Notion Wasn't Built for Active Recall</h2>
          <p>
            Notion is incredible for <strong>organizing information</strong>: creating wikis, databases, project boards, and shared workspaces. But when it comes to actually <em>learning</em> that information, Notion falls short.
          </p>
          <p>
            The science is clear: <strong>active recall</strong> and <strong>spaced repetition</strong> are the two most effective study techniques. You need to test yourself with flashcards and space your reviews over increasing intervals. Notion has neither of these features built in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students who use Notion for studying end up re-reading their notes passively, one of the <strong>least effective</strong> study methods according to research. To use active recall with Notion, you need external plugins or must manually create toggle blocks as makeshift flashcards, with no scheduling.
          </p>

          <h2>Mayinab: Notes and Flashcards in One Place</h2>
          <p>
            In Mayinab, your study flow is seamless. Take a text note about a topic, then type <code>/flashcard</code> right below it to create a card. The flashcard lives <strong>inline with your notes</strong> in a chat-style timeline. No switching apps, no copy-pasting.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it's time to review, Mayinab's <strong>SM-2 spaced repetition</strong> algorithm schedules your cards automatically. You get flip mode or typing mode, streak tracking, and daily reminders. Your learning is powered by science, not just note storage.
          </p>

          <h2>Offline: A Critical Difference</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Notion is cloud-first</strong>. Your data lives on Notion's servers. While it caches recently viewed pages for offline access, you can't create new pages, search across your workspace, or access content you haven't recently opened. None of this works without internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab is local-first</strong>. Everything is stored on your device. It works in airplane mode, in the library basement, on a train with no signal. You never need internet to study. Optional encrypted cloud backup (AES-256) is available but never required.
          </p>
          <p>
            For students who study in places with unreliable internet, such as university libraries, commutes, or travel, this is a game-changer.
          </p>

          <h2>Privacy: Your Notes, Your Device</h2>
          <p>
            With Notion, your notes are stored on their cloud servers. They have access to your data, and their privacy policy allows data processing for various purposes. If Notion goes down, your notes are temporarily inaccessible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mayinab takes a fundamentally different approach: <strong>your data never leaves your device</strong>. No account required, no tracking, no analytics. If you choose cloud backup, it's encrypted with AES-256 before leaving your device; even Mayinab can't read it.
          </p>

          <h2>7 Note Types vs. Notion Blocks</h2>
          <p>
            Notion's block system is incredibly flexible: text, headings, toggles, tables, databases, embeds, and more. It's a <strong>general-purpose workspace</strong> that can be bent into almost anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mayinab takes a focused approach with <strong>7 purpose-built note types</strong> for studying:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Text notes</strong>: Markdown + LaTeX, wiki-links, #tags</li>
            <li><strong>Flashcards</strong>: flip and typing modes, SM-2 scheduling</li>
            <li><strong>Checklists</strong>: track study goals and tasks</li>
            <li><strong>Image notes</strong>: with built-in scribble pad for annotations</li>
            <li><strong>Audio notes</strong>: record or attach lectures</li>
            <li><strong>Video notes</strong>: embed video references</li>
            <li><strong>File attachments</strong>: drag & drop PDFs, slides, documents</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Everything is organized in a <strong>Subject → Topic</strong> hierarchy with unlimited nesting. Less flexible than Notion's databases, but laser-focused on what students actually need.
          </p>

          <h2>Desktop Experience</h2>
          <p>
            Both apps offer strong desktop experiences, but with different philosophies:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mayinab</strong>: Resizable split-view, Discord-style sidebar, command palette (Ctrl+K), full keyboard shortcuts, custom themes with wallpapers</li>
            <li><strong>Notion</strong>: Clean page-based layout, side peek panels, breadcrumb navigation, team collaboration features</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you need a <strong>team workspace with databases</strong>, Notion wins. If you need a <strong>personal study station with flashcards and SRS</strong>, Mayinab is purpose-built for that.
          </p>

            <h3>🍵 The Verdict</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Notion</strong> is a powerful general-purpose tool. But for studying, where active recall, spaced repetition, and focused review sessions matter, it's not the right tool for the job.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Mayinab</strong> does one thing exceptionally well: <strong>help you study and actually remember what you learn</strong>. If your goal is to ace exams, retain knowledge long-term, and avoid the "note-and-forget" trap, Mayinab is the better choice.

          <p>
            O <strong>Notion</strong> é uma ferramenta de produtividade fantástica: wikis, bancos de dados, quadros de projeto, workspaces compartilhados. Mas ele nunca foi feito para estudar. Não tem flashcards, não tem repetição espaçada, não tem agendamento de revisões, e o suporte offline é limitado.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab</strong> foi projetado desde o início como um <strong>app focado em estudo</strong>. Notas e flashcards vivem juntos na mesma timeline. A repetição espaçada (SM-2) agenda suas revisões automaticamente. Sem copiar e colar, sem integrações de terceiros, sem internet necessária.
          </p>

          <h2>O Notion Não Foi Feito para Recall Ativo</h2>
          <p>
            O Notion é incrível para <strong>organizar informação</strong>: wikis, bancos de dados, quadros de projeto e workspaces compartilhados. Mas quando se trata de realmente <em>aprender</em> essa informação, o Notion fica devendo.
          </p>
          <p>
            A ciência é clara: <strong>recall ativo</strong> e <strong>repetição espaçada</strong> são as duas técnicas de estudo mais eficazes. Você precisa se testar com flashcards e espaçar revisões em intervalos crescentes. O Notion não tem nenhum desses recursos nativamente.
          </p>
          <p>
            Estudantes que usam o Notion acabam relendo suas notas passivamente, um dos métodos de estudo <strong>menos eficazes</strong> segundo pesquisas. Para usar recall ativo no Notion, você precisa de plugins externos ou criar blocos toggle como flashcards improvisados, sem agendamento.
          </p>

          <h2>Mayinab: Notas e Flashcards no Mesmo Lugar</h2>
          <p>
            No Mayinab, seu fluxo de estudo é contínuo. Faça uma anotação sobre um tema, depois digite <code>/flashcard</code> logo abaixo para criar um card. O flashcard fica <strong>junto com suas notas</strong> em uma timeline estilo chat. Sem trocar de app, sem copiar e colar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Na hora de revisar, o algoritmo <strong>SM-2 de repetição espaçada</strong> do Mayinab agenda seus cards automaticamente. Você tem modo flip ou digitação, rastreamento de streak e lembretes diários. Seu aprendizado é baseado em ciência, não apenas armazenamento de notas.
          </p>

          <h2>Offline: Uma Diferença Crítica</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Notion é cloud-first</strong>. Seus dados ficam nos servidores do Notion. Embora ele faça cache de páginas recentes para acesso offline, você não pode criar novas páginas, buscar no workspace ou acessar conteúdo que não abriu recentemente. Nada disso funciona sem internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab é local-first</strong>. Tudo fica armazenado no seu dispositivo. Funciona no modo avião, no subsolo da biblioteca, no trem sem sinal. Você nunca precisa de internet para estudar. Backup cloud criptografado (AES-256) opcional, nunca obrigatório.
          </p>
          <p>
            Para estudantes que estudam em lugares com internet instável, como bibliotecas universitárias, transporte ou viagens, isso muda tudo.
          </p>

          <h2>Privacidade: Suas Notas, Seu Dispositivo</h2>
          <p>
            No Notion, suas notas ficam em servidores na nuvem. Eles têm acesso aos seus dados e a política de privacidade permite processamento para diversos fins. Se o Notion cair, suas notas ficam temporariamente inacessíveis.
          </p>
          <p>
            O Mayinab tem uma abordagem fundamentalmente diferente: <strong>seus dados nunca saem do seu dispositivo</strong>. Sem conta obrigatória, sem rastreamento, sem analytics. Se você optar pelo backup cloud, ele é criptografado com AES-256 antes de sair do dispositivo; nem o Mayinab consegue ler.
          </p>

          <h2>7 Tipos de Nota vs. Blocos do Notion</h2>
          <p>
            O sistema de blocos do Notion é incrivelmente flexível: texto, headings, toggles, tabelas, bancos de dados, embeds e mais. É um <strong>workspace de propósito geral</strong> que pode ser moldado para quase qualquer coisa.
          </p>
          <p>
            O Mayinab tem uma abordagem focada com <strong>7 tipos de nota construídos para estudo</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Notas de texto</strong>: Markdown + LaTeX, wiki-links, #tags</li>
            <li><strong>Flashcards</strong>: modos flip e digitação, agendamento SM-2</li>
            <li><strong>Checklists</strong>: acompanhe metas e tarefas de estudo</li>
            <li><strong>Notas com imagem</strong>: com scribble pad integrado para anotações</li>
            <li><strong>Notas de áudio</strong>: grave ou anexe aulas</li>
            <li><strong>Notas de vídeo</strong>: referências em vídeo</li>
            <li><strong>Anexos de arquivo</strong>: arraste e solte PDFs, slides, documentos</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Tudo organizado em hierarquia <strong>Matéria → Tópico</strong> com aninhamento ilimitado. Menos flexível que os bancos de dados do Notion, mas focado no que estudantes realmente precisam.
          </p>

          <h2>Experiência Desktop</h2>
          <p>
            Ambos os apps oferecem experiências desktop fortes, mas com filosofias diferentes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mayinab</strong>: Visão dividida redimensionável, sidebar estilo Discord, paleta de comandos (Ctrl+K), atalhos de teclado completos, temas customizáveis com wallpapers</li>
            <li><strong>Notion</strong>: Layout baseado em páginas, painéis side peek, navegação por breadcrumbs, recursos de colaboração em equipe</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Se você precisa de um <strong>workspace em equipe com bancos de dados</strong>, o Notion vence. Se precisa de uma <strong>estação de estudo pessoal com flashcards e SRS</strong>, o Mayinab foi feito para isso.
          </p>

            <h3>🍵 O Veredicto</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Notion</strong> é uma ferramenta de propósito geral poderosa. Mas para estudar, onde recall ativo, repetição espaçada e sessões de revisão focadas importam, não é a ferramenta certa.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Mayinab</strong> faz uma coisa excepcionalmente bem: <strong>ajudar você a estudar e realmente lembrar o que aprendeu</strong>. Se seu objetivo é tirar boas notas, reter conhecimento a longo prazo e evitar a armadilha de "anotar e esquecer", o Mayinab é a melhor escolha.
