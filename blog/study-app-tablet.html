          <h2>Why Tablets Are Perfect for Studying</h2>
          <p>
            Tablets have become the ideal device for students. They offer a <strong>large, comfortable screen</strong> for reading and note-taking, the portability of a smartphone, and enough power to run full-featured apps. Whether you have an <strong>iPad</strong>, a <strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab</strong>, or any Android tablet, your tablet can become a powerful study station.
          </p>
          <p>
            But most note-taking apps were designed for phones first, then scaled up to tablets as an afterthought. The result is stretched-out phone interfaces with wasted screen space. A proper tablet study app should use the extra real estate for <strong>split-view panels</strong>, <strong>comfortable flashcard reviewing</strong>, and <strong>organized navigation</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mayinab</strong> was designed to work beautifully on tablets. It adapts to large screens with resizable split-view panels, a sidebar for quick navigation, and a layout that makes studying on a tablet feel natural.
          </p>

          <h2>Split-View: The Tablet Study Advantage</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest advantage of studying on a tablet is <strong>screen space</strong>. Unlike a phone, where you can only see one thing at a time, a tablet lets you use Mayinab's <strong>split-view panels</strong> to work with two panes side by side.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's how students use split-view on tablets:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Notes + Flashcards</strong>: Read your notes on the left, review flashcards on the right</li>
            <li><strong>Subject + Topic</strong>: Browse your subject list on the left, read topic content on the right</li>
            <li><strong>Reference + Notes</strong>: Open an image or PDF attachment on one side, take notes on the other</li>
            <li><strong>Review + Progress</strong>: See your review session on one pane and your streak dashboard on the other</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The panels are <strong>resizable</strong>. Drag the divider to give more space to whichever pane you're focusing on. This mirrors the desktop experience, making your tablet feel like a proper study workstation.
          </p>

          <h2>Comfortable Flashcard Reviews on a Big Screen</h2>
          <p>
            Reviewing flashcards on a phone can feel cramped: small text, tiny buttons, constant scrolling. On a tablet, Mayinab's flashcard review mode uses the full screen width for <strong>large, readable cards</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You get two review modes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Flip mode</strong>: See the question, tap to reveal the answer, rate your recall (Again, Hard, Good, Easy)</li>
            <li><strong>Typing mode</strong>: Type your answer before revealing the correct one for deeper active recall</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The <strong>SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm</strong> schedules your next review based on how well you remembered each card. Cards you struggle with appear more frequently; cards you know well are spaced out over days and weeks. This is the same algorithm used by Anki, backed by decades of cognitive science research.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a tablet, the larger buttons and more spacious layout make reviewing sessions <strong>faster and less fatiguing</strong>. You can review 50-100 cards comfortably in one sitting.
          </p>

          <h2>iPad: The Ultimate Study Tablet</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>iPad</strong> is one of the most popular tablets for students, and Mayinab is fully optimized for it. Here is what you get on iPad:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Native iOS app</strong> from the App Store</li>
            <li><strong>Split-view panels</strong> adapted to iPadOS multitasking</li>
            <li><strong>Apple Pencil support</strong> in the scribble pad for handwritten annotations</li>
            <li><strong>Keyboard shortcuts</strong> with Magic Keyboard and Smart Keyboard</li>
            <li><strong>Dark mode</strong> that follows iPadOS system settings</li>
            <li><strong>Offline everywhere</strong>: no Wi-Fi needed on campus, in transit, or at home</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Whether you have an iPad Air, iPad Pro, or the base iPad, Mayinab adapts to your screen size. The split-view is especially powerful on the 11" and 12.9" iPad Pro, where you have enough space to comfortably read notes and review flashcards side by side.
          </p>

          <h2>Samsung Galaxy Tab: Study on Galaxy's Big Screen</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Galaxy Tab S series</strong> tablets are powerful study devices, and Mayinab takes full advantage of the large AMOLED display. If you're coming from Samsung Notes and need more study power, Mayinab is the perfect complement.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Store</strong> install, optimized for Galaxy Tab screens</li>
            <li><strong>Split-view</strong> with Samsung's DeX mode and multi-window</li>
            <li><strong>S Pen compatible</strong> in the scribble pad for quick annotations</li>
            <li><strong>Keyboard support</strong> with Samsung Book Cover Keyboard</li>
            <li><strong>Samsung Notes + Mayinab workflow</strong>: use Samsung Notes for handwriting in class, Mayinab for studying at home</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This means you don't have to choose between Samsung Notes and Mayinab. Use <strong>Samsung Notes for capturing</strong> (handwriting, voice recordings, PDF annotation) and <strong>Mayinab for studying</strong> (flashcards, spaced repetition, organized review). Best of both worlds.
          </p>

          </p>

          <h2>Android Tablets: Full Support on Every Device</h2>
          <p>
            Beyond Galaxy Tab, Mayinab works on <strong>all Android tablets</strong>: Xiaomi Pad, Lenovo Tab, OnePlus Pad, Amazon Fire tablets (via sideloading), and any device running Android. The interface adapts to the screen size, giving you the split-view experience on any tablet with enough screen space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Android tablets are often more affordable than iPads, making them accessible to students on a budget. Mayinab is <strong>completely free</strong> with no premium tier, so you get a full-featured study app on an affordable device.
          </p>

          <h2>Study Anywhere: 100% Offline on Tablets</h2>
          <p>
            Many students use tablets <strong>without mobile data</strong> and rely on Wi-Fi. This means in transit, at the library during outages, or on a flight, most cloud-based apps stop working.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mayinab works <strong>100% offline by default</strong>. All your notes, flashcards, and review schedules are stored locally on your tablet. You never need an internet connection to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create and edit notes</li>
            <li>Create and review flashcards</li>
            <li>Follow your SM-2 review schedule</li>
            <li>See your streak and progress stats</li>
            <li>Browse and organize subjects and topics</li>
            <li>Use the scribble pad</li>
            <li>Access all 7 note types</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Optional <strong>AES-256 encrypted cloud backup</strong> lets you sync across devices when you have Wi-Fi. But it's never required. Your tablet is a fully self-contained study station.
          </p>

          <h2>7 Note Types: More Than Just Text</h2>
          <p>
            Most tablet note apps focus on text and handwriting. Mayinab gives you <strong>7 note types</strong> designed for comprehensive studying:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Text notes</strong>: Full Markdown + LaTeX support, wiki-links, #tags, headings</li>
            <li><strong>Flashcards</strong>: Front/back cards with flip and typing modes, SM-2 scheduling</li>
            <li><strong>Checklists</strong>: Track study goals, task lists, and habits</li>
            <li><strong>Image notes</strong>: Attach photos and annotate with the scribble pad</li>
            <li><strong>Audio notes</strong>: Record lectures or attach audio files</li>
            <li><strong>Video notes</strong>: Embed video references inline with your notes</li>
            <li><strong>File attachments</strong>: Drag and drop PDFs, slides, and documents</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All note types live together in a <strong>chat-style timeline</strong> inside each topic. This means flashcards sit right next to the notes they refer to, context is never lost.
          </p>

          <h2>Markdown + LaTeX: Perfect for STEM on Tablets</h2>
          <p>
            Tablets are increasingly popular with <strong>STEM students</strong> who need to write formulas, equations, and code. Mayinab supports:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Full Markdown</strong>: Headings, bold, italic, code blocks, lists, links, and more</li>
            <li><strong>LaTeX math</strong>: Write <code>$E = mc^2$</code> or complex integrals and see them rendered beautifully</li>
            <li><strong>Code blocks</strong>: Syntax highlighting for programming notes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            On a tablet's large screen, rendered LaTeX formulas are <strong>easy to read and review</strong>. Create flashcards with LaTeX on the front and back for efficient math and physics review.
          </p>

          <h2>Keyboard and Stylus: Tablet Productivity</h2>
          <p>
            Modern tablets support external keyboards and styluses, turning them into laptop replacements for students. Mayinab supports both:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Keyboard shortcuts</strong>: Navigate subjects, create notes, start reviews with keyboard commands</li>
            <li><strong>Stylus/pen support</strong>: Use Apple Pencil, S Pen, or any stylus in the scribble pad</li>
            <li><strong>Command palette</strong>: Press Ctrl+K (or Cmd+K) to quickly search and navigate</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With a keyboard attached, your tablet becomes a <strong>full study workstation</strong>. Type notes with Markdown formatting, create flashcards with <code>/flashcard</code>, and review cards all without touching the screen.
          </p>

          <h2>Cross-Platform: Start on Tablet, Continue on Phone or Desktop</h2>
          <p>
            Your study notes shouldn't be trapped on one device. Mayinab runs on <strong>Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux</strong>. Start studying on your Galaxy Tab during your commute, continue on your Windows laptop at home, and do a quick review on your iPhone during a break.
          </p>
          <p>
            With <strong>optional encrypted cloud backup</strong> (AES-256), all your notes, flashcards, and review progress sync seamlessly across devices. Your SM-2 review schedule follows you everywhere.
          </p>

          <h2>Por Que Tablets São Perfeitos para Estudar</h2>
          <p>
            Tablets se tornaram o dispositivo ideal para estudantes. Oferecem uma <strong>tela grande e confortável</strong> para leitura e anotações, a portabilidade de um smartphone e poder suficiente para rodar apps completos. Seja no <strong>iPad</strong>, no <strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab</strong> ou em qualquer tablet Android, seu tablet pode ser uma estação de estudo poderosa.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mas a maioria dos apps de anotação foi feita para celular primeiro e depois adaptada para tablet como algo secundário. O resultado são interfaces de celular esticadas com espaço desperdiçado. Um app de estudo para tablet de verdade deve usar o espaço extra para <strong>painéis split-view</strong>, <strong>revisão confortável de flashcards</strong> e <strong>navegação organizada</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            O <strong>Mayinab</strong> foi projetado para funcionar perfeitamente em tablets. Ele se adapta a telas grandes com painéis split-view redimensionáveis, sidebar para navegação rápida e um layout que torna o estudo no tablet natural.
          </p>

          <h2>Split-View: A Vantagem do Tablet para Estudos</h2>
          <p>
            A maior vantagem de estudar em um tablet é o <strong>espaço de tela</strong>. Diferente de um celular, onde só se vê uma coisa por vez, um tablet permite usar os <strong>painéis split-view</strong> do Mayinab para trabalhar com dois painéis lado a lado.
          </p>
          <p>
            Veja como estudantes usam o split-view no tablet:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Notas + Flashcards</strong>: Leia suas notas à esquerda, revise flashcards à direita</li>
            <li><strong>Matéria + Tópico</strong>: Navegue pela lista de matérias à esquerda, leia o conteúdo do tópico à direita</li>
            <li><strong>Referência + Notas</strong>: Abra uma imagem ou PDF de um lado, faça anotações do outro</li>
            <li><strong>Revisão + Progresso</strong>: Veja sua sessão de revisão em um painel e seu dashboard de streak no outro</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Os painéis são <strong>redimensionáveis</strong>. Arraste o divisor para dar mais espaço ao painel que está focando. Isso espelha a experiência desktop, fazendo seu tablet parecer uma estação de estudo completa.
          </p>

          <h2>Revisão Confortável de Flashcards em Tela Grande</h2>
          <p>
            Revisar flashcards no celular pode ser apertado: texto pequeno, botões minúsculos, rolagem constante. No tablet, o modo de revisão do Mayinab usa toda a largura da tela para <strong>cards grandes e legíveis</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Você tem dois modos de revisão:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Modo flip</strong>: Veja a pergunta, toque para revelar a resposta, avalie seu recall (De Novo, Difícil, Bom, Fácil)</li>
            <li><strong>Modo digitação</strong>: Digite sua resposta antes de revelar a correta para um recall ativo mais profundo</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            O <strong>algoritmo SM-2 de repetição espaçada</strong> agenda sua próxima revisão com base em quão bem você lembrou de cada card. Cards que você erra aparecem com mais frequência; cards que você sabe são espaçados ao longo de dias e semanas. É o mesmo algoritmo do Anki, respaldado por décadas de pesquisa em ciência cognitiva.
          </p>
          <p>
            No tablet, os botões maiores e o layout mais espaçoso tornam as sessões de revisão <strong>mais rápidas e menos cansativas</strong>. Você consegue revisar 50-100 cards confortavelmente em uma sessão.
          </p>

          <h2>iPad: O Tablet Definitivo para Estudos</h2>
          <p>
            O <strong>iPad</strong> é um dos tablets mais populares entre estudantes, e o Mayinab é totalmente otimizado para ele. Veja o que você ganha no iPad:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>App iOS nativo</strong> da App Store</li>
            <li><strong>Painéis split-view</strong> adaptados ao multitasking do iPadOS</li>
            <li><strong>Suporte ao Apple Pencil</strong> no scribble pad para anotações manuscritas</li>
            <li><strong>Atalhos de teclado</strong> com Magic Keyboard e Smart Keyboard</li>
            <li><strong>Modo escuro</strong> que acompanha as configurações do iPadOS</li>
            <li><strong>Offline em todo lugar</strong>: sem Wi-Fi necessário no campus, em trânsito ou em casa</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Seja no iPad Air, iPad Pro ou iPad básico, o Mayinab se adapta ao tamanho da sua tela. O split-view é especialmente poderoso no iPad Pro de 11" e 12,9", onde há espaço suficiente para ler notas e revisar flashcards lado a lado confortavelmente.
          </p>

          <h2>Samsung Galaxy Tab: Estude na Tela Grande do Galaxy</h2>
          <p>
            Os tablets <strong>Galaxy Tab S</strong> são dispositivos poderosos para estudo, e o Mayinab aproveita totalmente a grande tela AMOLED. Se você vem do Samsung Notes e precisa de mais recursos de estudo, o Mayinab é o complemento perfeito.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Instalação pela Google Play Store</strong>, otimizado para telas Galaxy Tab</li>
            <li><strong>Split-view</strong> com modo DeX e multi-window da Samsung</li>
            <li><strong>Compatível com S Pen</strong> no scribble pad para anotações rápidas</li>
            <li><strong>Suporte a teclado</strong> com Samsung Book Cover Keyboard</li>
            <li><strong>Fluxo Samsung Notes + Mayinab</strong>: use o Samsung Notes para escrever em aula, Mayinab para estudar em casa</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Isso significa que você não precisa escolher entre Samsung Notes e Mayinab. Use o <strong>Samsung Notes para capturar</strong> (escrita à mão, gravações de voz, anotação em PDF) e o <strong>Mayinab para estudar</strong> (flashcards, repetição espaçada, revisão organizada). O melhor dos dois mundos.

          </p>

          <h2>Tablets Android: Suporte Completo em Qualquer Dispositivo</h2>
          <p>
            Além do Galaxy Tab, o Mayinab funciona em <strong>todos os tablets Android</strong>: Xiaomi Pad, Lenovo Tab, OnePlus Pad, tablets Amazon Fire (via sideloading) e qualquer dispositivo com Android. A interface se adapta ao tamanho da tela, oferecendo a experiência split-view em qualquer tablet com espaço suficiente.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tablets Android costumam ser mais acessíveis que iPads, tornando-os mais acessíveis para estudantes com orçamento limitado. O Mayinab é <strong>completamente grátis</strong> sem plano premium, então você tem um app de estudo completo em um dispositivo acessível.
          </p>

          <h2>Estude em Qualquer Lugar: 100% Offline no Tablet</h2>
          <p>
            Muitos estudantes usam tablets <strong>sem dados móveis</strong> e dependem de Wi-Fi. Isso significa que no transporte, na biblioteca durante quedas de conexão ou em um voo, a maioria dos apps baseados em nuvem para de funcionar.
          </p>
          <p>
            O Mayinab funciona <strong>100% offline por padrão</strong>. Todas as suas notas, flashcards e agendamentos de revisão ficam armazenados localmente no tablet. Você nunca precisa de internet para:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Criar e editar notas</li>
            <li>Criar e revisar flashcards</li>
            <li>Seguir seu cronograma de revisão SM-2</li>
            <li>Ver seu streak e estatísticas de progresso</li>
            <li>Navegar e organizar matérias e tópicos</li>
            <li>Usar o scribble pad</li>
            <li>Acessar todos os 7 tipos de nota</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            O <strong>backup cloud criptografado com AES-256</strong> opcional permite sincronizar entre dispositivos quando há Wi-Fi. Mas nunca é obrigatório. Seu tablet é uma estação de estudo completa e autônoma.
          </p>

          <h2>7 Tipos de Nota: Mais do Que Apenas Texto</h2>
          <p>
            A maioria dos apps de anotação para tablet foca em texto e escrita à mão. O Mayinab oferece <strong>7 tipos de nota</strong> feitos para estudo completo:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Notas de texto</strong>: Markdown completo + LaTeX, wiki-links, #tags, headings</li>
            <li><strong>Flashcards</strong>: Cards frente/verso com modos flip e digitação, agendamento SM-2</li>
            <li><strong>Checklists</strong>: Acompanhe metas, listas de tarefas e hábitos de estudo</li>
            <li><strong>Notas com imagem</strong>: Anexe fotos e anote com o scribble pad</li>
            <li><strong>Notas de áudio</strong>: Grave aulas ou anexe arquivos de áudio</li>
            <li><strong>Notas de vídeo</strong>: Referências em vídeo junto com suas notas</li>
            <li><strong>Anexos de arquivo</strong>: Arraste e solte PDFs, slides e documentos</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Todos os tipos de nota ficam juntos em uma <strong>timeline estilo chat</strong> dentro de cada tópico. Isso significa que flashcards ficam ao lado das notas que referenciam, o contexto nunca se perde.
          </p>

          <h2>Markdown + LaTeX: Perfeito para Exatas no Tablet</h2>
          <p>
            Tablets são cada vez mais populares com <strong>estudantes de exatas</strong> que precisam escrever fórmulas, equações e código. O Mayinab suporta:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Markdown completo</strong>: Headings, negrito, itálico, blocos de código, listas, links e mais</li>
            <li><strong>LaTeX matemático</strong>: Escreva <code>$E = mc^2$</code> ou integrais complexas e veja renderizados perfeitamente</li>
            <li><strong>Blocos de código</strong>: Syntax highlighting para notas de programação</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Na tela grande do tablet, fórmulas LaTeX renderizadas são <strong>fáceis de ler e revisar</strong>. Crie flashcards com LaTeX na frente e no verso para revisão eficiente de matemática e física.
          </p>

          <h2>Teclado e Caneta: Produtividade no Tablet</h2>
          <p>
            Tablets modernos suportam teclados externos e canetas, transformando-os em substitutos de notebook para estudantes. O Mayinab suporta ambos:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Atalhos de teclado</strong>: Navegue matérias, crie notas, inicie revisões com comandos do teclado</li>
            <li><strong>Suporte a caneta/stylus</strong>: Use Apple Pencil, S Pen ou qualquer caneta no scribble pad</li>
            <li><strong>Paleta de comandos</strong>: Pressione Ctrl+K (ou Cmd+K) para buscar e navegar rapidamente</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Com teclado conectado, seu tablet se torna uma <strong>estação de estudo completa</strong>. Digite notas com formatação Markdown, crie flashcards com <code>/flashcard</code> e revise cards tudo sem tocar na tela.
          </p>

          <h2>Multiplataforma: Comece no Tablet, Continue no Celular ou Desktop</h2>
          <p>
            Suas notas de estudo não devem ficar presas em um dispositivo. O Mayinab roda em <strong>Android, iOS, Windows, macOS e Linux</strong>. Comece a estudar no Galaxy Tab durante o trajeto, continue no notebook Windows em casa e faça uma revisão rápida no iPhone durante um intervalo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Com o <strong>backup cloud criptografado opcional</strong> (AES-256), todas as suas notas, flashcards e progresso de revisão sincronizam perfeitamente entre dispositivos. Seu cronograma de revisão SM-2 acompanha você em todo lugar.

            <h3>🍵 O Veredicto</h3>
            <p>
              Tablets são o dispositivo ideal para estudar: portáteis, tela grande e poderosos o suficiente para qualquer app. Mas a maioria dos apps de estudo não aproveita os pontos fortes do tablet.
            </p>
            <p>
              O <strong>Mayinab</strong> foi feito para tablets desde o início. Painéis split-view, revisão confortável de flashcards, atalhos de teclado, suporte a caneta e operação 100% offline fazem dele o <strong>melhor app de estudo para qualquer tablet</strong>. iPad, Galaxy Tab ou qualquer tablet Android, seu fluxo de estudo é o mesmo em todo lugar.
