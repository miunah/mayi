          <h2>Why Japanese Is Hard (and Why Most People Quit)</h2>
          <p>
            Japanese is one of the most challenging languages for English speakers. The U.S. Foreign Service Institute estimates it takes <strong>2,200 class hours</strong> to reach professional proficiency. Three writing systems (hiragana, katakana, kanji), complex grammar, and thousands of characters make it easy to feel overwhelmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most learners quit within the first 6 months. The reason? <strong>They forget faster than they learn.</strong> Without a system to retain what you study, you're constantly re-learning the same kanji, the same vocabulary, the same grammar patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spaced repetition solves this problem. Instead of letting knowledge fade, it schedules reviews at the exact moment you're about to forget, turning short-term memories into permanent ones.
          </p>

          <h2>The 3 Pillars of Japanese Study</h2>
          <p>
            An effective Japanese study plan covers three main areas, and each benefits enormously from flashcards and spaced repetition:
          </p>

          <h3>1. Writing Systems: Hiragana, Katakana & Kanji</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Hiragana</strong> (46 characters) and <strong>katakana</strong> (46 characters) can be learned in 1-2 weeks with dedicated flashcard practice. Create one card per character with the symbol on the front and the romanized reading on the back.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Kanji</strong> is the real challenge. There are <strong>2,136 jouyou kanji</strong> (commonly used characters) that Japanese students learn by the end of high school. Each kanji has multiple readings (on'yomi and kun'yomi) and meanings. Without spaced repetition, memorizing even 500 kanji is nearly impossible.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Mayinab, you can create kanji flashcards with the character on front and all readings + meanings on the back. Use <strong>typing mode</strong> to practice writing the readings, or <strong>flip mode</strong> for quick recognition drills.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Vocabulary</h3>
          <p>
            Japanese vocabulary often combines kanji into compound words (jukugo). For example: 学生 (gakusei = student), 先生 (sensei = teacher), 大学 (daigaku = university).
          </p>
          <p>
            Create vocabulary flashcards with the <strong>Japanese word on front</strong> and the <strong>reading + meaning on back</strong>. Include example sentences for context. With SM-2 spaced repetition, you can systematically build a vocabulary of thousands of words without forgetting old ones.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Grammar Patterns</h3>
          <p>
            Japanese grammar is structured around patterns. Each JLPT level introduces dozens of new grammar points. Create flashcards with the <strong>grammar pattern on front</strong> and the <strong>explanation + example sentence on back</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Front:</strong> ~てもいいですか (te mo ii desu ka)</li>
            <li><strong>Back:</strong> "May I...?" / Permission request. Example: 写真を撮ってもいいですか? (May I take a photo?)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How to Study Japanese with Mayinab</h2>
          <p>
            Mayinab combines <strong>notes and flashcards in one app</strong>, which is perfect for Japanese study. Here's a step-by-step approach:
          </p>

          <h3>Step 1: Organize by JLPT Level or Textbook</h3>
          <p>
            Create separate notebooks for each JLPT level (N5, N4, N3, N2, N1) or for each chapter of your textbook (Genki, Minna no Nihongo, Tobira, etc.). This keeps your study material structured and easy to navigate.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 2: Take Notes First, Then Create Flashcards</h3>
          <p>
            When studying a new grammar point or vocabulary list, write your notes explaining the concept. Then immediately create flashcards below your notes using <code>/flashcard</code>. This way, your flashcards always have context nearby.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 3: Use Both Review Modes</h3>
          <p>
            Mayinab offers <strong>flip mode</strong> (see the front, try to recall, flip to check) and <strong>typing mode</strong> (type the answer to verify). Use flip mode for kanji recognition and typing mode for readings and vocabulary.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 4: Review Daily</h3>
          <p>
            The SM-2 algorithm schedules your reviews automatically. Spend <strong>15-30 minutes daily</strong> reviewing due cards. Consistency beats marathon sessions. Over weeks, you'll notice kanji and vocabulary sticking permanently.
          </p>

          <h2>Flashcard Strategies for Japanese</h2>

          <h3>Kanji Cards</h3>
          <p>
            The most effective format for kanji flashcards:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Front:</strong> The kanji character (e.g., 食)</li>
            <li><strong>Back:</strong> On'yomi: ショク (shoku) | Kun'yomi: た.べる (ta.beru) | Meaning: eat, food</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Keep one kanji per card. Don't overload with too many readings at once. Start with the most common reading and add others as you encounter them.
          </p>

          <h3>Vocabulary Cards</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Front:</strong> 図書館 (としょかん)</li>
            <li><strong>Back:</strong> Library. Example: 図書館で勉強します。(I study at the library.)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Grammar Cards</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Front:</strong> ~なければならない (~nakereba naranai)</li>
            <li><strong>Back:</strong> "Must do ~" / obligation. Example: 宿題をしなければならない。(I must do my homework.)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Sentence Cards (for Advanced Learners)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Front:</strong> 彼は日本語が上手になりたいと言っていました。</li>
            <li><strong>Back:</strong> He was saying that he wants to become good at Japanese. (Grammar: ~たい + と言う + ~ていました)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Study Plan by JLPT Level</h2>

          <h2>Tips for Effective Japanese Study</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Learn hiragana and katakana first</strong> before touching kanji. Use flashcards for 1-2 weeks until you can read them instantly.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't study kanji in isolation.</strong> Always learn kanji with vocabulary words that use them.</li>
            <li><strong>Use example sentences.</strong> Japanese words often have different nuances depending on context. Include sentences in your flashcards.</li>
            <li><strong>Review daily, even if just 10 minutes.</strong> Spaced repetition only works with consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Start with the most frequent words.</strong> The 1,000 most common words cover ~80% of everyday Japanese.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine passive and active study.</strong> Use Mayinab for active recall, but also watch anime, read manga, or listen to podcasts for immersion.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't add too many new cards.</strong> 10-15 new cards per day is sustainable. 50+ will cause review pile-up.</li>
          </ol>

            <h3>🍵 Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p>
              Japanese requires memorizing thousands of kanji, vocabulary words, and grammar patterns. <strong>Spaced repetition is the most efficient way to do this.</strong> Mayinab lets you take notes and create flashcards in one place, with SM-2 scheduling, dual review modes, and full offline support.
            </p>
            <p>

          <h2>Por que Japones E Dificil (e Por que a Maioria Desiste)</h2>
          <p>
            O japones e um dos idiomas mais desafiadores para falantes de portugues. O Foreign Service Institute dos EUA estima que sao necessarias <strong>2.200 horas de aula</strong> para atingir proficiencia profissional. Tres sistemas de escrita (hiragana, katakana, kanji), gramatica complexa e milhares de caracteres tornam facil se sentir sobrecarregado.
          </p>
          <p>
            A maioria dos estudantes desiste nos primeiros 6 meses. O motivo? <strong>Esquecem mais rapido do que aprendem.</strong> Sem um sistema para reter o que estuda, voce fica constantemente re-aprendendo os mesmos kanji, o mesmo vocabulario, os mesmos padroes gramaticais.
          </p>
          <p>
            A repeticao espacada resolve esse problema. Em vez de deixar o conhecimento desaparecer, ela agenda revisoes no momento exato em que voce esta prestes a esquecer, transformando memorias de curto prazo em permanentes.
          </p>

          <h2>Os 3 Pilares do Estudo de Japones</h2>
          <p>
            Um plano de estudo eficaz de japones cobre tres areas principais, e cada uma se beneficia enormemente de flashcards e repeticao espacada:
          </p>

          <h3>1. Sistemas de Escrita: Hiragana, Katakana e Kanji</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Hiragana</strong> (46 caracteres) e <strong>katakana</strong> (46 caracteres) podem ser aprendidos em 1-2 semanas com pratica dedicada de flashcards. Crie um card por caractere com o simbolo na frente e a leitura romanizada no verso.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Kanji</strong> e o verdadeiro desafio. Existem <strong>2.136 jouyou kanji</strong> (caracteres de uso comum) que estudantes japoneses aprendem ate o fim do ensino medio. Cada kanji tem multiplas leituras (on'yomi e kun'yomi) e significados. Sem repeticao espacada, memorizar ate 500 kanji e quase impossivel.
          </p>
          <p>
            No Mayinab, voce pode criar flashcards de kanji com o caractere na frente e todas as leituras + significados no verso. Use o <strong>modo digitacao</strong> para praticar escrevendo as leituras, ou o <strong>modo flip</strong> para exercicios rapidos de reconhecimento.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Vocabulario</h3>
          <p>
            O vocabulario japones frequentemente combina kanji em palavras compostas (jukugo). Por exemplo: 学生 (gakusei = estudante), 先生 (sensei = professor), 大学 (daigaku = universidade).
          </p>
          <p>
            Crie flashcards de vocabulario com a <strong>palavra em japones na frente</strong> e a <strong>leitura + significado no verso</strong>. Inclua frases de exemplo para contexto. Com a repeticao espacada SM-2, voce pode construir sistematicamente um vocabulario de milhares de palavras sem esquecer as antigas.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Padroes Gramaticais</h3>
          <p>
            A gramatica japonesa e estruturada em padroes. Cada nivel do JLPT introduz dezenas de novos pontos gramaticais. Crie flashcards com o <strong>padrao gramatical na frente</strong> e a <strong>explicacao + frase de exemplo no verso</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Por exemplo:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Frente:</strong> ~てもいいですか (te mo ii desu ka)</li>
            <li><strong>Verso:</strong> "Posso...?" / Pedido de permissao. Exemplo: 写真を撮ってもいいですか? (Posso tirar uma foto?)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Como Estudar Japones com o Mayinab</h2>
          <p>
            O Mayinab combina <strong>notas e flashcards em um app</strong>, o que e perfeito para estudar japones. Veja o passo a passo:
          </p>

          <h3>Passo 1: Organize por Nivel JLPT ou Livro</h3>
          <p>
            Crie cadernos separados para cada nivel do JLPT (N5, N4, N3, N2, N1) ou para cada capitulo do seu livro (Genki, Minna no Nihongo, Tobira, etc.). Isso mantem seu material estruturado e facil de navegar.
          </p>

          <h3>Passo 2: Faca Notas Primeiro, Depois Crie Flashcards</h3>
          <p>
            Ao estudar um novo ponto gramatical ou lista de vocabulario, escreva suas notas explicando o conceito. Depois, crie flashcards imediatamente abaixo usando <code>/flashcard</code>. Assim, seus flashcards sempre tem contexto por perto.
          </p>

          <h3>Passo 3: Use Ambos os Modos de Revisao</h3>
          <p>
            O Mayinab oferece <strong>modo flip</strong> (veja a frente, tente lembrar, vire para conferir) e <strong>modo digitacao</strong> (digite a resposta para verificar). Use o modo flip para reconhecimento de kanji e o modo digitacao para leituras e vocabulario.
          </p>

          <h3>Passo 4: Revise Diariamente</h3>
          <p>
            O algoritmo SM-2 agenda suas revisoes automaticamente. Gaste <strong>15-30 minutos diarios</strong> revisando cards pendentes. Consistencia supera sessoes maratona. Ao longo das semanas, voce percebera kanji e vocabulario ficando permanentemente na memoria.
          </p>

          <h2>Estrategias de Flashcard para Japones</h2>

          <h3>Cards de Kanji</h3>
          <p>
            O formato mais eficaz para flashcards de kanji:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Frente:</strong> O caractere kanji (ex: 食)</li>
            <li><strong>Verso:</strong> On'yomi: ショク (shoku) | Kun'yomi: た.べる (ta.beru) | Significado: comer, comida</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Mantenha um kanji por card. Nao sobrecarregue com muitas leituras de uma vez. Comece com a leitura mais comum e adicione outras conforme encontra-las.
          </p>

          <h3>Cards de Vocabulario</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Frente:</strong> 図書館 (としょかん)</li>
            <li><strong>Verso:</strong> Biblioteca. Exemplo: 図書館で勉強します。(Eu estudo na biblioteca.)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Cards de Gramatica</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Frente:</strong> ~なければならない (~nakereba naranai)</li>
            <li><strong>Verso:</strong> "Preciso/Devo fazer ~" / obrigacao. Exemplo: 宿題をしなければならない。(Preciso fazer a licao de casa.)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Dicas para Estudo Eficaz de Japones</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Aprenda hiragana e katakana primeiro</strong> antes de tocar em kanji. Use flashcards por 1-2 semanas ate conseguir le-los instantaneamente.</li>
            <li><strong>Nao estude kanji isoladamente.</strong> Sempre aprenda kanji com palavras de vocabulario que os usam.</li>
            <li><strong>Use frases de exemplo.</strong> Palavras japonesas frequentemente tem nuances diferentes dependendo do contexto. Inclua frases nos seus flashcards.</li>
            <li><strong>Revise diariamente, mesmo que apenas 10 minutos.</strong> Repeticao espacada so funciona com consistencia.</li>
            <li><strong>Comece pelas palavras mais frequentes.</strong> As 1.000 palavras mais comuns cobrem ~80% do japones cotidiano.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine estudo passivo e ativo.</strong> Use o Mayinab para recall ativo, mas tambem assista anime, leia manga ou ouca podcasts para imersao.</li>
            <li><strong>Nao adicione cards demais.</strong> 10-15 novos cards por dia e sustentavel. 50+ vai causar acumulo de revisoes.</li>
          </ol>
