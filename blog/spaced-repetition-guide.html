          <h2>The Forgetting Curve Problem</h2>
          <p>
            In 1885, German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered that we forget new information at a predictable rate. Within <strong>24 hours</strong>, we lose up to 70% of what we learned. After a week, nearly 90% is gone. This is the <strong>forgetting curve</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most students deal with this by cramming, re-reading notes and textbooks the night before a test. It feels productive, but research consistently shows that cramming produces <strong>short-term recall at best</strong>. The information vanishes within days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spaced repetition is the antidote to the forgetting curve. It works <em>with</em> your brain's natural memory patterns instead of against them.
          </p>

          <h2>What Is Spaced Repetition?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Spaced repetition</strong> is a study technique where you review information at <strong>increasing intervals</strong> over time. Instead of reviewing everything at once, you revisit each piece of knowledge just before you're likely to forget it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's how the intervals typically grow:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Learn the concept</li>
            <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> First review (1-day interval)</li>
            <li><strong>Day 5:</strong> Second review (3-day interval)</li>
            <li><strong>Day 12:</strong> Third review (7-day interval)</li>
            <li><strong>Day 30:</strong> Fourth review (18-day interval)</li>
            <li><strong>Day 90:</strong> Fifth review (60-day interval)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each successful review <strong>doubles or triples</strong> the time until the next review. Over weeks and months, a concept you initially struggled with moves into long-term memory, and you spend less and less time reviewing it.
          </p>

          <h2>The Science Behind It</h2>
          <p>
            Spaced repetition is backed by over a century of cognitive science research. Two key principles make it work:
          </p>

          <h3>1. The Spacing Effect</h3>
          <p>
            Spreading study sessions over time produces <strong>stronger and more durable memories</strong> than massed practice (cramming). This effect has been replicated in hundreds of studies across different subjects, age groups, and types of material.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Active Recall</h3>
          <p>
            Testing yourself, actively retrieving information from memory, is <strong>3x more effective</strong> than passively re-reading notes. When you see a flashcard and try to recall the answer before flipping it, you're using active recall. This act of retrieval strengthens the neural pathways associated with that memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spaced repetition combines both: you <strong>actively recall</strong> information at <strong>spaced intervals</strong>. This one-two combination is why it's considered the most effective study technique ever discovered.
          </p>

          <h2>The SM-2 Algorithm Explained</h2>
          <p>
            The most widely used spaced repetition algorithm is <strong>SM-2</strong> (SuperMemo 2), created by Piotr Wozniak in 1987. Apps like Anki and Mayinab use this algorithm to calculate optimal review intervals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's how SM-2 works in simple terms:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Each flashcard has an <strong>ease factor</strong> (starting at 2.5) that tracks how easy it is for you</li>
            <li>After each review, you rate your recall (e.g., "again", "hard", "good", "easy")</li>
            <li>If you answer correctly, the <strong>interval increases</strong> based on the ease factor</li>
            <li>If you answer incorrectly, the card <strong>resets to a short interval</strong></li>
            <li>The ease factor adjusts over time. Easy cards get longer intervals, hard cards get shorter ones</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The result: you spend most of your study time on material you find difficult, while easy material is reviewed less and less frequently. <strong>Maximum learning, minimum time.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2>How to Start Using Spaced Repetition</h2>
          <p>
            You can do spaced repetition manually with paper flashcards and a calendar, but a <strong>software tool</strong> automates the scheduling and makes it effortless. Here's a practical guide to get started:
          </p>

          <h3>Step 1: Choose the Right Tool</h3>
          <p>
            You need an app that supports SM-2 algorithm scheduling. Popular options include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mayinab</strong>: Notes + flashcards + SM-2 in one app. Modern UI, offline, free.</li>
            <li><strong>Anki</strong>: Powerful SRS, steep learning curve, dated interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Quizlet</strong>: Limited free tier, cloud-dependent, basic SRS.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 2: Write Good Flashcards</h3>
          <p>
            The quality of your flashcards matters more than the quantity. Follow these principles:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>One idea per card</strong>: don't cram multiple concepts</li>
            <li><strong>Ask specific questions</strong>: "What is X?" beats "Tell me everything about X"</li>
            <li><strong>Use your own words</strong>: paraphrasing improves understanding</li>
            <li><strong>Include context</strong>: add examples or connections to other knowledge</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 3: Study Consistently</h3>
          <p>
            Spaced repetition only works if you <strong>review daily</strong>. It doesn't take long; 15-30 minutes per day is usually enough. The key is consistency:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Review your due cards every day, no exceptions</li>
            <li>Don't add too many new cards at once (10-20 per day is ideal)</li>
            <li>Trust the algorithm; don't review cards before they're due</li>
            <li>Track your streak for motivation</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 4: Create Cards While Learning</h3>
          <p>
            The best time to make flashcards is <strong>while taking notes</strong>. In Mayinab, you can type a note and immediately create a flashcard below it using <code>/flashcard</code>. This eliminates the friction of copying content between apps.
          </p>

          <h2>Spaced Repetition for Different Subjects</h2>

          <h3>Languages</h3>
          <p>
            Vocabulary, grammar rules, and verb conjugations are perfect for spaced repetition. Create cards for new words as you encounter them and let the algorithm handle review scheduling.
          </p>

          <h3>Medicine & Sciences</h3>
          <p>
            Medical students have used Anki for years because there's a massive amount of factual knowledge to retain. Anatomy, pharmacology, pathology: all benefit enormously from spaced repetition.
          </p>

          <h3>Law</h3>
          <p>
            Legal terminology, case precedents, statutory provisions, and constitutional articles are ideal for flashcard-based spaced repetition.
          </p>

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>
            Syntax, design patterns, algorithms, and API references can be retained long-term through spaced repetition instead of constant Googling.
          </p>

          <h3>History & Humanities</h3>
          <p>
            Dates, events, key figures, philosophical concepts, and literary analysis. All can be encoded as flashcards and reviewed at optimal intervals.
          </p>

          <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Making cards too complex</strong>: Keep one fact per card</li>
            <li><strong>Skipping review days</strong>: Consistency matters more than marathon sessions</li>
            <li><strong>Adding too many cards</strong>: Start with 10-20 new cards per day</li>
            <li><strong>Copying verbatim from textbooks</strong>: Use your own words for better retention</li>
            <li><strong>Not combining with notes</strong>: Flashcards without context are harder to remember</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why Mayinab Is Ideal for Spaced Repetition</h2>
          <p>
            Most spaced repetition apps only do flashcards. Mayinab is different because it combines <strong>notes and flashcards in one timeline</strong>, so your study context is never lost.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>SM-2 algorithm</strong> with configurable intervals</li>
            <li><strong>Flip mode + typing mode</strong> for different review styles</li>
            <li><strong>Daily reminders</strong> and streak tracking</li>
            <li><strong>7 note types</strong>: text, flashcards, checklists, images, audio, video, files</li>
            <li><strong>Markdown + LaTeX</strong> for STEM subjects</li>
            <li><strong>100% offline</strong>: no internet needed, no data collection</li>
            <li><strong>Free forever</strong>: all features included, no ads</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="verdict-box">
            <h3>🍵 Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p>
              Spaced repetition is the <strong>most effective study technique backed by science</strong>. It works by reviewing information at increasing intervals, combining the spacing effect with active recall to build durable long-term memory.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best way to start is with an app that automates the scheduling. Mayinab makes it simple: take notes and create flashcards in the same place, and let the SM-2 algorithm tell you exactly what to review and when. Free, offline, and available on every platform.

          <h2>O Problema da Curva do Esquecimento</h2>
          <p>
            Em 1885, o psicólogo alemão Hermann Ebbinghaus descobriu que esquecemos informações novas em uma taxa previsível. Em <strong>24 horas</strong>, perdemos até 70% do que aprendemos. Após uma semana, quase 90% se foi. Essa é a <strong>curva do esquecimento</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A maioria dos estudantes lida com isso fazendo decoreba, relendo notas e livros na véspera da prova. Parece produtivo, mas pesquisas consistentemente mostram que decoreba produz <strong>memorização de curto prazo no máximo</strong>. A informação desaparece em dias.
          </p>
          <p>
            A repetição espaçada é o antídoto para a curva do esquecimento. Ela funciona <em>a favor</em> dos padrões naturais de memória do seu cérebro, não contra eles.
          </p>

          <h2>O que É Repetição Espaçada?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Repetição espaçada</strong> é uma técnica de estudo onde você revisa informações em <strong>intervalos crescentes</strong> ao longo do tempo. Em vez de revisar tudo de uma vez, você revisita cada conceito exatamente antes de esquecê-lo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Veja como os intervalos tipicamente crescem:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Dia 1:</strong> Aprenda o conceito</li>
            <li><strong>Dia 2:</strong> Primeira revisão (intervalo de 1 dia)</li>
            <li><strong>Dia 5:</strong> Segunda revisão (intervalo de 3 dias)</li>
            <li><strong>Dia 12:</strong> Terceira revisão (intervalo de 7 dias)</li>
            <li><strong>Dia 30:</strong> Quarta revisão (intervalo de 18 dias)</li>
            <li><strong>Dia 90:</strong> Quinta revisão (intervalo de 60 dias)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Cada revisão bem-sucedida <strong>dobra ou triplica</strong> o tempo até a próxima revisão. Ao longo de semanas e meses, um conceito que inicialmente era difícil passa para a memória de longo prazo, e você gasta cada vez menos tempo revisando.
          </p>

          <h2>A Ciência por Trás</h2>
          <p>
            A repetição espaçada é respaldada por mais de um século de pesquisa em ciência cognitiva. Dois princípios-chave a fazem funcionar:
          </p>

          <h3>1. O Efeito de Espaçamento</h3>
          <p>
            Distribuir sessões de estudo ao longo do tempo produz <strong>memórias mais fortes e duráveis</strong> do que prática massiva (decoreba). Este efeito foi replicado em centenas de estudos em diferentes matérias, faixas etárias e tipos de material.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Recall Ativo</h3>
          <p>
            Testar a si mesmo, recuperar ativamente informações da memória, é <strong>3x mais eficaz</strong> do que reler passivamente. Quando você vê um flashcard e tenta lembrar a resposta antes de virá-lo, está usando recall ativo. Esse ato de recuperação fortalece as vias neurais associadas àquela memória.
          </p>
          <p>
            A repetição espaçada combina ambos: você <strong>relembra ativamente</strong> informações em <strong>intervalos espaçados</strong>. Essa combinação é por isso que é considerada a técnica de estudo mais eficaz já descoberta.
          </p>

          <h2>O Algoritmo SM-2 Explicado</h2>
          <p>
            O algoritmo de repetição espaçada mais usado é o <strong>SM-2</strong> (SuperMemo 2), criado por Piotr Wozniak em 1987. Apps como Anki e Mayinab usam esse algoritmo para calcular intervalos ideais de revisão.
          </p>
          <p>
            Veja como o SM-2 funciona em termos simples:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Cada flashcard tem um <strong>fator de facilidade</strong> (começando em 2.5) que rastreia quão fácil é para você</li>
            <li>Após cada revisão, você avalia seu recall (ex: "de novo", "difícil", "bom", "fácil")</li>
            <li>Se acertar, o <strong>intervalo aumenta</strong> baseado no fator de facilidade</li>
            <li>Se errar, o card <strong>volta para um intervalo curto</strong></li>
            <li>O fator de facilidade se ajusta ao longo do tempo. Cards fáceis ganham intervalos mais longos, difíceis mais curtos</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            O resultado: você gasta a maior parte do tempo de estudo em material que acha difícil, enquanto material fácil é revisado cada vez menos. <strong>Máximo aprendizado, mínimo tempo.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2>Como Começar a Usar Repetição Espaçada</h2>
          <p>
            Você pode fazer repetição espaçada manualmente com flashcards de papel e um calendário, mas um <strong>software</strong> automatiza o agendamento e torna tudo mais fácil. Veja um guia prático:
          </p>

          <h3>Passo 1: Escolha a Ferramenta Certa</h3>
          <p>
            Você precisa de um app que suporte o algoritmo SM-2. Opções populares incluem:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mayinab</strong>: Notas + flashcards + SM-2 em um app. UI moderna, offline, grátis.</li>
            <li><strong>Anki</strong>: SRS poderoso, curva de aprendizado íngreme, interface datada.</li>
            <li><strong>Quizlet</strong>: Plano grátis limitado, dependente de nuvem, SRS básico.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Passo 2: Crie Bons Flashcards</h3>
          <p>
            A qualidade dos seus flashcards importa mais que a quantidade. Siga estes princípios:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Uma ideia por card</strong>: não aglomere múltiplos conceitos</li>
            <li><strong>Faça perguntas específicas</strong>: "O que é X?" é melhor que "Conte tudo sobre X"</li>
            <li><strong>Use suas próprias palavras</strong>: parafrasear melhora a compreensão</li>
            <li><strong>Inclua contexto</strong>: adicione exemplos ou conexões com outros conhecimentos</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Passo 3: Estude Consistentemente</h3>
          <p>
            A repetição espaçada só funciona se você <strong>revisar diariamente</strong>. Não leva muito tempo; 15-30 minutos por dia geralmente bastam. A chave é consistência:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Revise seus cards pendentes todo dia, sem exceção</li>
            <li>Não adicione cards demais de uma vez (10-20 por dia é ideal)</li>
            <li>Confie no algoritmo; não revise cards antes da hora</li>
            <li>Acompanhe seu streak para motivação</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Passo 4: Crie Cards Enquanto Aprende</h3>
          <p>
            O melhor momento para criar flashcards é <strong>enquanto faz anotações</strong>. No Mayinab, você pode escrever uma nota e imediatamente criar um flashcard abaixo usando <code>/flashcard</code>. Isso elimina a fricção de copiar conteúdo entre apps.
          </p>

          <h2>Repetição Espaçada para Diferentes Matérias</h2>

          <h3>Idiomas</h3>
          <p>
            Vocabulário, regras gramaticais e conjugações verbais são perfeitos para repetição espaçada. Crie cards para palavras novas conforme as encontra e deixe o algoritmo cuidar do agendamento.
          </p>

          <h3>Medicina & Ciências</h3>
          <p>
            Estudantes de medicina usam o Anki há anos porque há uma quantidade massiva de conhecimento factual para reter. Anatomia, farmacologia, patologia: tudo se beneficia enormemente da repetição espaçada.
          </p>

          <h3>Direito</h3>
          <p>
            Terminologia jurídica, precedentes, dispositivos legais e artigos constitucionais são ideais para repetição espaçada com flashcards.
          </p>

          <h3>Programação</h3>
          <p>
            Sintaxe, padrões de design, algoritmos e referências de API podem ser retidos a longo prazo com repetição espaçada em vez de pesquisar constantemente no Google.
          </p>

          <h3>História & Humanas</h3>
          <p>
            Datas, eventos, figuras-chave, conceitos filosóficos e análise literária. Tudo pode ser codificado como flashcards e revisado em intervalos ideais.
          </p>

          <h2>Erros Comuns a Evitar</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Criar cards muito complexos</strong>: Mantenha um fato por card</li>
            <li><strong>Pular dias de revisão</strong>: Consistência importa mais que sessões maratona</li>
            <li><strong>Adicionar cards demais</strong>: Comece com 10-20 novos cards por dia</li>
            <li><strong>Copiar textos literalmente</strong>: Use suas próprias palavras para melhor retenção</li>
            <li><strong>Não combinar com notas</strong>: Flashcards sem contexto são mais difíceis de lembrar</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Por que o Mayinab É Ideal para Repetição Espaçada</h2>
          <p>
            A maioria dos apps de repetição espaçada só faz flashcards. O Mayinab é diferente porque combina <strong>notas e flashcards em uma timeline</strong>, então o contexto do seu estudo nunca se perde.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Algoritmo SM-2</strong> com intervalos configuráveis</li>
            <li><strong>Modo flip + modo digitação</strong> para diferentes estilos de revisão</li>
            <li><strong>Lembretes diários</strong> e rastreamento de streak</li>
            <li><strong>7 tipos de nota</strong>: texto, flashcards, checklists, imagens, áudio, vídeo, arquivos</li>
            <li><strong>Markdown + LaTeX</strong> para exatas</li>
            <li><strong>100% offline</strong>: sem internet necessária, sem coleta de dados</li>
            <li><strong>Grátis para sempre</strong>: todos os recursos incluídos, sem anúncios</li>
          </ul>
